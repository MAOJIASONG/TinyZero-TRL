==============
<think> First, let's see if we can form an equation involving 48 and 90, since these numbers seem close to our target of 95. We can see that 90 - 48 = 42. </think>
Now, let's see what we can do with 53. It seems like we might be able to form an equation with 53 that, when combined with 42, would equal something close to 95. </think>
<think> If we subtract 42 from 95, we get 53. That's a nice number! We can now see that the equation would be <answer> 90 - 48 + 53 </answer>. This equation evaluates to 95. </think>
珝
"<answer> 90 - 48 + 53 </answer>"

==============
<think> First, I'll try different combinations of arithmetic operations between the numbers to see if I can get 24.</think>

I have the numbers [28, 1, 44, 40]. I can try doing the following:
1. Add 28 and 40 to get 68. The remaining numbers are 1 and 44, and I can't get 24 using these numbers without repeating the operations.
2. Multiply 28 by 1 and then subtract 44 from the result, getting (28*1) - 44 = 4. I don't need the remaining numbers to get 24.
3. Add 44 and 1 and then divide by 28, getting (44+1)/28 = 1.642857. Using the remaining number 40 is not helpful.
4. Divide 44 by 40 and then add 28, getting (44/40) + 28 = 32.5. I can't use the remaining number 1.
5. Subtract the smallest number (1) from each of the other numbers: 28-1=27, 44-1=43, and 40-1=39. Now my numbers are [27, 43, 39]. If I add all three of them, I get 27+43+39=109. But I need 24!
6. The last option is to subtract the smallest number (1) from each of the other numbers twice. That is equivalent to adding the original number (2) to the remaining numbers. So I'll add 2 to all three of the remaining numbers keeping in mind that each number must be used only once. That is, [27+2, 43+2, 39+2] = [29, 45, 41].
7. Now I have three numbers [29, 45, 41]. I'll divide one of them, say 29, by one of the remaining numbers, say 41. That's 29/41. My final numbers are [45, 41, 41].
8. Now I'll divide one of these numbers (say 45) by the smallest remaining number (41). That's 45/41. My final numbers are [41, 41].
9. Now I'll add these two numbers together. That's 41+41=82. But I need 24!
10. I notice that 41+41 has a bell-like symmetry. I'll try subtracting one of these numbers from the other number (41-41) and look at what I get.

So, this is my final equation:

==============
<think>First, I'll find out if any number can be the result of an operation with the other two numbers. In this case, 74 is too big, so I won't use it. Next, I'll try to divide 10 by 25. This gives me a result of 0.4. Finally, I'll try to add 74 to that result. This gives me 74.4, which is not equal to 59. Since I'm not able to create an equation using these numbers, I need to use additional numbers. For example, I can use 74 minus 25 and add 10, which equals 59.</think>
<answer> (74 - 25) + 10 </answer>

==============
<think>First, I'll add 59 and 83. The result is 142. Then, I'll subtract 142 by 95 to get 47. Hence, the equation is 59 + 83 - 95.</think>
<answer>59 + 83 - 95</answer>

==============
<think>First, let's consider the options provided. We have three numbers: 37, 44, and 15. We want to find a combination that, when used with basic arithmetic operations, gives us a result of 22.</think>
<think>Let's start with the 44 first. If we add or subtract 44 from 37 or 15, we don't get 22. Let's try multiplication and division. Multiplying 15 by 44 gives us 660, which is not equal to 22. Dividing 15 by 44 gives us 0.3375, which is not equal to 22 either.</think>
<think>Now let's try using the 37. Adding or subtracting 37 from 44 or 15 doesn't give us 22. However, if we subtract 37 from 15, we get -22. We can add 44 to -22 to get 22. The equation is (15 - 37) + 44 = 22.</think>
<answer>(15 - 37) + 44</answer>

==============
<think>First, I'll consider the given numbers. The numbers available are [77, 54, 47, 10]. To reach the desired result of 94, I'll try adding different combinations of the given numbers. I'll start with the largest number, 77. I can subtract 47 from 77, which gives me 30. Next, I'll add 54 to 30, which brings the result to 84. Now, I have to add another number to reach the target of 94. Since 10 is the smallest number, I'll add 10 to 84. This will give me the final result of 94.</think>

<answer> (77 - 47) + 54 + 10 </answer>


==============
<think> First, let's check if we can combine these numbers using basic arithmetic operations. 91 is the target value, so we'll start with that. If we try adding and subtracting the numbers, we can't get 91 as a result. If we try multiplying and dividing, we can get 91. Let's see if we can get there using the numbers we have. </think>
<answer> 91 / (65 - 64) </answer>

==============
<think> I should place the larger numbers as they will yield higher results when added or multiplied. Think of 70 + 22 = 92, which is closer to the target than 97. Better yet, if I also use 49, I can add or subtract it. </think>
<answer> (70 + 49) - 22 </answer>


==============
<think> First, I will try to think of two numbers that can be combined to make 82. I see that 93 and 61 are close to 82. If I take 93 and subtract 11, I will get 82. So, the equation will be 93 - 11. Now, I will calculate 11 using 50 and 61. If I subtract 50 from 61, I will get 11. So, the equation will be 61 - 50. Therefore, the final equation will be (93 - (61 - 50)). </think>
<answer> (93 - (61 - 50)) </answer>

==============
<think> To make the equation equal 72 with the given numbers 46, 76, and 50, we need to consider how we can manipulate these numbers using basic arithmetic operations. Let's start by looking at the numbers and seeing what combinations we can try. The number 76 seems like a good candidate to contribute to the final result since 76 is already fairly close to 72. If we subtract 50 from 76 (which would give us 26), we are left with 26, which is also close to 72. Adding 46 to 26 (which would give us 72) gives us an equation that works. </think>
<answer> 76 - 50 + 46 </answer>

==============
<think> 
1. We have two numbers that are smaller than 38: 64 and 6.
2. Adding 64 + 6 = 70, this is too large so I will try subtracting 64 from 96 instead: 96 - 64 = 32.
3. Now I have the numbers 32 and 6, and I need to find a way to get to 38.
4. Adding 6 to 32 gives me 38.
</think>
<answer> ((96 - 64) + 6) </answer>

==============
<think> We need to use basic arithmetic operations and each number can only be used once to equal 52. 
Starting with 82, we can subtract 29 to get 53. Then subtract 1 to get 52. So the equation will be 82 - 29 - 1 = 52. </think>
<answer> (82 - 29) - 1 </answer>

==============
<think> I have the numbers 11, 70, 7. I can see that 70 - 11 = 59. Then I can add 7 to 59 to get 66.</think>
<answer> (70 - 11) + 7 </answer>

==============
<think> We want to create an equation that equals 85 using the numbers 82, 82, and 85. We can start by subtracting one of the 82s from 85 to get 3. Then, we can add the other 82 to get 85. So the equation is 85 - 82 + 82 = 85. </think>
<answer> 85 - 82 + 82 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll add 35 and 7, then subtract the result from 60, and finally add 50. This will give me 32. </think>
<answer> (35 + 7) - 60 + 50 </answer>

==============
<think>First, we need to get close to 93. Then we can find what the last operational symbol is. If we add 75 and 13, we get 88. Now we can add 5 to get to 93. Since we want to start with 75 and add the other two numbers, the last symbol must be the plus sign. </think>
<answer> 75 + 13 + 5 </answer>

==============
<think>First, I'll start by adding the numbers 65 and 58. This gives me 123. Then, I can subtract 56 from 123, which gives me 67. The equation is 65 + 58 - 56 = 67.</think>
<answer>65 + 58 - 56</answer>

==============
<think> To achieve this, we can use the numbers 65 and 58. Let's start with these. 65 minus 56 equals 9. Then, multiplying by 58 gives us 506. However, 506 is already more than 67, which is not possible with just the combination of 65 and 58. Now let's try to include the third number, 56. If we take 65 minus 56, we get 9. Adding 58 to this result gives us 67. Therefore, the equation is 65 - 56 + 58 = 67. </think>
<answer> 65 - 56 + 58 </answer>

==============
<think> First, we need to add 89 and 92 to get 181. Then, we subtract 81 from 181 to get the sum of 100. Therefore, the equation is (89 + 92) - 81 = 100 </think>
<answer> (89 + 92) - 81 </answer>

==============
<think> 
First, let's try to see if we can get 38 by adding or subtracting the numbers. We can try 5 + 41, but that doesn't equal 38. Then, we can try 51 - 5, which also doesn't work. Next, let's try multiplying and then adding or subtracting. 5 * 41 is too big, so let's try subtracting 51 from 74, which equals 23. Then, we can subtract 23 from 41 to get 18. Finally, we can add 18 to 5 to get 23, and then subtract 41 from 74 to get 38. </think>
<answer>(74 - 41) + 5</answer>

==============
<think> 
I want to end up with 79 using the numbers 25, 63, and 41. I can add 41 to get to 64. Then, I need to add 15 more to get to 79. I can subtract 12 from 41 to get 25. So, the equation would be 63 - 25 = 38, and then 38 + 41 = 79.
</think>
<answer> (63 - 25) + 41 </answer>

==============
<think> We need to find an equation that uses the numbers [39, 68, 13] to get 94.
To add the first two numbers, we get 39 + 68 = 107.
To subtract 13 from 107, we get 107 - 13 = 94.
So the equation is 39 + 68 - 13 = 94. </think>
<answer> 39 + 68 - 13 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's identify the target number, which is 47. We can start by adding the first number 12 with the second number 21. This gives us 33. Now, we have 47 - 33 = 14. We need another 14, so we can add the third number 14 to our result. That gives us 14 + 14 = 28. So far, we have 33 + 14 = 47. </think>
<answer> 12 + 21 + 14 </answer>

==============
<think> We can try to add numbers together to get closer to 96. If we add 94 and 72, we get 166. Now we need to subtract something from here to get to 96. So, let's check if subtracting 70 will result in 96. 166 - 70 = 96. Therefore, the equation is 94 + 72 - 70 = 96. </think>
<answer> 94 + 72 - 70 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to add 70 and 17 to get 87. Then, I can subtract 9 from 87 to get 78. So, the equation is (70 + 17) - 9. </think>
<answer> (70 + 17) - 9 </answer>

==============
<think> I start by observing the target number, 47, and the available numbers, [62, 51, 36]. The easiest way to reach 47 seems by adding or subtracting smaller numbers. If I add 36 to the largest number, I get 98, which is too much. If I subtract 36 from the largest number, I get 26, which is still too much. If I subtract 51 from the largest number, I get 11, which is not enough. So I try adding 51 to 36, which gives me 87. This is still too much. If I subtract 51 from 87, I get 36, which is the smallest number we have. So adding 51 and then subtracting 36 gives me 47. </think>
<answer> 62 - (51 - 36) </answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll see if addition can be used to reach 23. If not, I'll try subtraction. 20 + 77 is 97, which is too big. I'll try 77 - 20, which is 57, which is still too big. Next, I'll try 34 + 77, which is 111, which is also too big. Now, let's try 34 + 20, which is 54. Lastly, I'll try 77 - 34, which is 43. But none of these addends equal 23. I found one addend minus another equals 23, so I'll try 77 - (34 + 20). Subtracting 20 from 34 gives 14. Subtracting 14 from 77 gives 63, which is still too big. I'll try 77 - (34 + 20) and subtract 14 from 77, which gives 34. 23 is still not there, so I'll do (77 - 34) - 20. This subtracts 34 from 77, resulting in 43, and then another 20 subtracted is 23. </think>
<answer> (77 - 34) - 20 </answer>

<think> We need to combine 8 and 16 to get 24. To reach 28, we just need to add 4 to 24. Therefore, the equation is 8 + 16 + 4 = 28. </think>
<answer> 8 + 16 + 4 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll try finding the difference between 84 and 24, which is 60. Then I'll subtract 23 from 60 to get 37. So the equation will be 84 - 24 - 23 = 37. </think>
<answer> (84 - 24) - 23 </answer>

==============
<think>First, I will look for a combination of two of the numbers that add up to 50. Then I will add the third number to the result. So, 86 and 42 add up to 128, and adding 49 to that gives me 177 - which is incorrect. So, I will subtract 86 from 128 instead, which gives me 42. </think>
<answer> 86 - 42 + 49 </answer>

==============
<think> Start with smaller numbers and then add the bigger ones. Subtract a smaller number from 86 to get closer to 93. Then add 49 to get 93. </think>
<answer> 86 - 42 + 49 </answer>

==============
<think> First, we have 78 and 92. We can subtract 78 from 92 to get 14. Now, we have 8 and 14. We can add 8 and 14 to get 22. </think>

<think> 
First, we can try to add 94 and 40 to get 134. Then we can subtract 51 from 134 to get 83. So the equation would be (94 + 40) - 51 = 83.
</think>
<answer> (94 + 40) - 51 </answer>

==============
<think> To get 93, we need to add 76 and 17. Since we only have 4 and 21, we can subtract 4 from 21 to get 17. So the equation will be (21 - 4) + 76 = 93. </think>
<answer> (21 - 4) + 76 </answer>

==============
<think>First, we need to find two numbers that add up to make 51 when combined with 56. We can use 15, since 56 + 19 = 75 and 75 - 24 = 51. Now we have the equation 56 + 19 - 24 = 51. </think>
<answer>56 + 19 - 24</answer>

<think> We want [88] with the given numbers [79, 22, 13]. [88] can be obtained by subtracting [13] from [101], but [101] is not in the given list. We can get [101] by adding [79] and [22]. So, [88] can be obtained by subtracting [13] from [79] plus [22], which gives [90] and then subtracting another [2] (not from the given list, but from the result of [90] - [13] = [77]). </think>

<answer> 77 - (51 + 16) </answer>

==============
<think> First, we need to get as close to 88 as possible using the numbers 38, 28, and 98. Adding 28 to 98 gives us 126. Then, subtracting 38 from 126 gives us 88. So the equation is: 98 + 28 - 38 = 88. </think>

==============
<think> To create an equation that equals 37 using the numbers 46, 19, and 28, let's start by looking at what numbers I can easily manipulate to get close to 37. I see that if I use subtraction, I can subtract 28 from 46 to get 18. Then, if I add 19 to that result, I get 37. Therefore, the equation should be (46 - 28) + 19 = 37. </think>

==============
<think> First, I'll calculate 8 + 28, which equals 36. Then, I'll subtract 7 from 36, which leaves me with 29. So, the equation is 8 + 28 - 7 = 29. </think>

<think> I need to create an equation that equals 10 using the numbers 11, 73, and 94 only once. If I subtract 73 from 94 I get 21. Now, if I subtract 21 from 11 I get 10. So, the equation is: (94 - 73) - 11 = 10. </think>
<answer> (94 - 73) - 11 </answer>

==============
<think> To form an equation that equals 43 using the numbers [87, 40, 84], I need to find a combination of the numbers that will result in 43. I can't use any of the numbers more than once. The only combination that works is adding 87 and 40 and then subtracting 84. So the equation is (87 + 40) - 84 = 43. </think>

<think> First, we can try to find out what number when added to 63 equals 87, because 87 is the target number and 63 is the number we have. So, we need to subtract 63 from 87, which gives us 24. Now, we need to find a number that when multiplied by 94, equals 53, because 53 is another number we have. So, we need to divide 53 by 94, which gives us a fraction that doesn't simplify nicely. Next, we can try subtracting 17 from 87, which gives us 70. Now, we need to find a number that when subtracted from 53, equals 70, because 70 is the number we got from subtracting 17 from 87. So, we need to subtract 70 from 53, which gives us -17. We also have the number 94, so we can try to find a number between 17 and 94 that, when subtracted from 94, equals 63. So, we need to subtract 63 from 94, which gives us 31. Finally, we can put all these numbers together to get the equation: 63 + (94 - 53 - 17) = 87. </think>
<answer> 63 + (94 - 53 - 17) </answer>

==============
<think> I want to create an equation that equals 39 using the numbers 62, 89, and 12. First, I notice that 89 + 12 equals 101. Then, I need to subtract 62 from 101 to get 39. So, the equation is (89 + 12) - 62. </think>
<answer> (89 + 12) - 62 </answer>

==============
<think> First, we can perform the addition: 60 + 30 = 90. Then, we can subtract 30 from 90: 90 - 30 = 60. Finally, we can add 54 to 60: 60 + 54 = 114, which is not equal to 56. So, let's try another combination: 60 - 54 = 6, then we can add 54 to 6: 6 + 54 = 60, which is not 56. However, we can try 30 + 54 - 60 = 24 + 54 - 60 = 74 - 60 = 14, which is not 56. We need to try again. Let's use division: 60 / 30 = 2, then we can add 54 to 2: 2 + 54 = 56. </think>
<answer> (60 / 30) + 54 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to find an equation that equals 43 using the given numbers [9, 3, 9, 46]. First, I can subtract 3 from 46 to get 43. However, I need to use the remaining numbers [9, 9]. One way to do this is to add 9 to 43, which gives me 52. But now I have 52 with two 9s, so I can subtract 9 once more to get 43. Therefore, the equation is 46 - 3 + 9 - 9 = 43. </think>
<answer> (46 - 3) + 9 - 9 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's try to make 15 using 94 and 57. We can subtract 94 and 57 which gives us -41. Then, we can add 57 to -41 which gives us 16. However, 16 is more than 15, so let's try another combination. We can subtract 57 from 94 which gives us 37. Then, we can subtract 37 from 52 which gives us 52 - 37 = 15. </think>
<answer> 52 - 94 + 57 </answer>

==============
<think> First, we can start by calculating 81 + 59, which gives us 140. Then we can subtract 83 from 140, which leaves us with 57. So the equation is (81 + 59) - 83. </think>
<answer> (81 + 59) - 83 </answer>

==============
<think> We can start with adding 34 and 99 to get 133. Now, we need to get close to 39. Subtracting 94 from 133 gives us 39. So the equation is 34 + 99 - 94 = 39. </think>
<answer> (34 + 99) - 94 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's see if we can add or subtract 38 from 93 to get closer to 52. If so, we can then add or subtract 3 to reach exactly 52. So, 93 - 38 = 55, which is 3 more than 52. Now we need to subtract 3 more to get to 52. Therefore, the equation is 93 - 38 - 3 = 52. </think>
<answer> 93 - 38 - 3 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's look at the numbers available [80, 75, 63]. We need to find a way to get 68. We can start by adding 80 and 63, which gives us 143. Then, we can subtract 75 from 143, which gives us 68. </think>
<answer> 80 + 63 - 75 </answer>

<think> First, I need to find a way to get 33 using the given numbers. I can start by subtracting 48 from 91, which equals 43. Then I can subtract 10 from 43, which equals 33. </think>
<answer> 91 - 48 - 10 </answer>

==============
<think> Adding 60 and 23 equals 83. Then, subtracting 61 from 83 gives 22. Finally, adding 22 to 61 results in 83. Adding 83 and 60 results in 143, which is close to 98. So, a mistake was made in the prior steps. Therefore, the correct steps would be: 60 + 61 - 23 = 98.</think>
<answer> 60 + 61 - 23 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll try to find two numbers that can be added together to get close to 71. Adding 46 and 23 (which is 91 - 46) gives me 69. Then I'll use 37 to subtract from 69, which gives me 32. Finally, I'll add 79 to 32 to reach the desired result of 71. So, the equation is 46 + 37 - 91 + 79 = 71. </think>
<answer> 46 + 37 - 91 + 79 </answer>

==============
<think> 
To create an equation using the numbers [78, 29, 1] that equals 49, we can start by subtracting 29 from 78 to get 49. Then we can multiply the result by 1 to get 49. So the equation is 78 - 29 * 1 = 49.
</think>
<answer> (78 - 29) * 1 </answer>

<think> First, we want to get close to 94 using both 88 and 94. Adding 88 and 94 gives us 182. Now, since we need to subtract to get closer to 94, we will subtract 88 from 182, which gives us 94. </think>
<answer> 88 + 94 - 88 </answer>

==============
<think> First, we have to find a way to create an equation that equals 70 using the numbers 3, 11, and 5. We can start by trying to multiply the numbers and see if we can get close to 70. Multiplying 11 and 5 gives us 55, which is close to 70. Then we can multiply 11 by 3 and add 5 to it, since 11 * 3 is 33 and adding 5 to 33 gives us 38. And then subtracting 33 from 38 gives us 5. But that's not what we're looking for. Instead, let's try adding 3 and 11, which gives us 14, and then multiplying 14 by 5. This gives us 70, which is what we're looking for. </think>
<answer> (3 + 11) * 5 </answer>

==============
<think> 70 - 29 = 41, then 41 + 35 = 76, and finally 76 + 3 = 79. So the equation is 70 - 29 + 35 + 3. </think>
<answer> 70 - 29 + 35 + 3 </answer>

<think> First, we need to calculate 56 + 10. That gives us 66. Since we want to reach 71, we need to add 5 to it. So, the equation is (56 + 10) + 5 = 71. </think>
<answer> (56 + 10) + 5 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's add the numbers 6 and 95 to get 101. Then, we can subtract 67 from 101 to get 34. So the equation is (6 + 95) - 67 = 34. </think>

<think> First, I'll separate the given numbers: (72 - 4) = 68. Then, I'll add 7 to this result - 68 + 7 = 75. So, the equation is (72 - 4) + 7 = 75. </think>
<answer> (72 - 4) + 7 </answer>

==============
<think> First, we can try adding 76 and 17 to get 93. Then we can try subtracting 49 from 93 to get 44. So the equation would be (76 + 17) - 49 = 44. </think>
<answer> (76 + 17) - 49 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I want to find a combination of the numbers 59, 70, and 77 that equals 66. I can start by trying different combinations of addition and subtraction. If I subtract 77 from 59, I get -18. If I then subtract -18 from 70, I get 52. Since 52 is not 66, I need to try another combination. If I subtract 70 from 59, I get -11. If I then subtract -11 from 77, I get 66, which is what I wanted to find. </think>
<answer> 59 - (70 - 77) </answer>

<think> First, try adding 86 and 94. That gives us 180. Now subtract 88. That's 92. So the equation is (86 + 94) - 88. </think>
<answer> (86 + 94) - 88 </answer>

==============
<think> First, we need to find a combination of numbers that can be combined with [56] to get 69. We can add [45] and [32] to get [77]. Then, we can subtract [45] from [77] to get [32], and finally add [56] to get [69]. So, the equation is [32 + 32 = 64] and [64 + 56 = 120], which is too big. Let's try another combination: [56 - 32 = 24] and [24 + 45 = 69]. </think>
<answer> (56 - 32) + 45 </answer>

==============
<think>First, I'll try combining 48 and 31 to get 80. Then, I'll subtract 13 from 80 to get 67. Finally, I'll divide 67 by 2 to get 33.5, which is not equal to 30. Next, I'll try adding 48 and 13 to get 61, and then subtract 31 from it to get 30. </think>
<answer> (48 + 13) - 31 </answer>

==============
<think> I see the numbers 30, 30 and 36. Since 30 is half of 60 and 60 / 3 = 20, we can write 30 + 30 = 60. Now, if we subtract 36 from 60, we are left with 24. So, the equation is 30 + 30 - 36 = 24. </think>
<answer> 30 + 30 - 36 </answer>

==============
<think> We need to find a combination of the given numbers that equals 32. The closest number is 51, so let's subtract it from 32. That gives us 19. Now, we have 26 left, and we can add it to 19 to get 45. However, this doesn't match our target. Next, let's subtract 26 from 51, which gives us 25. Now, we have 7 left, and we can add it to 25 to get 32. So, the equation is (51 - 26) + 7 = 32. </think>
<answer> (51 - 26) + 7 </answer>

==============
<think> 
First, try adding the two largest numbers, 81 and 72. However, 81 + 72 is 153, which is too big. 
Next, try adding the two smallest numbers, 81 and 25. This gives us 106.
Then, try subtracting 106 from the second largest number, 72. This gives us 72 - 106 = -34.
So, the equation is 81 + 25 - 72 = 34.
</think>
<answer> (81 + 25) - 72 </answer>

==============
<think> We can start by adding 69 and 10 to get 79. Then we can subtract 87 from 79 to get 12. Finally, we can add 96 to 12 to get 108. Since 108 is too large, we can subtract 108 from 108 to get 0. Then we can add 108 to 0 to get 108. Finally, we can subtract 108 from 108 to get 0, which is not equal to 70. Therefore, we need to try another combination of numbers. Let's try adding 10 and 87 first. This gives us 97. Then we can subtract 97 from 69 to get -28. Finally, we can add 96 to -28 to get 68. Since 68 is too small, we can try subtracting 96 from 69 instead. This gives us -27. Then we can add 87 to -27 to get 60. Finally, we can subtract 60 from 87 to get 27, which is not equal to 70. Therefore, we need to try another combination of numbers. Let's try multiplying 10 and 96 first. This gives us 960. Since 960 is too large, we can try dividing 960 by 10 to get 96. Then we can add 69 to 96 to get 165. Finally, we can subtract 96 from 165 to get 69, which is not equal to 70. Therefore, we need to try another combination of numbers. Let's try adding 69 and 87 first. This gives us 156. Then we can subtract 96 from 156 to get 60. Finally, we can add 10 to 60 to get 70, which is equal to 70. Therefore, the equation is 69 + 87 - 96 + 10 = 70. </think>

==============
<think>First, let's try adding 61 and 56 to get 117. Then, we can subtract 77 from 117 to get 40. So the equation is (61 + 56) - 77. </think>
<answer> (61 + 56) - 77 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I observe that 64 and 55 are very close to 34. Let's use the first two numbers to try and get closer to it. If I subtract 64 from 55, I get -9. Then, if I add 27 to -9, I get 18. Now, I need to get from 18 to 34. I can do this by adding 16 to 18. So, the equation is 55 - 64 + 27 + 16. </think>
<answer> (55 - 64) + 27 + 16 </answer>

==============
<think> First, we need to find the value of 83 - 52 = 31. Then, we can add 39 to get 31 + 39 = 70. Finally, we can add 24 to get 70 + 24 = 94. Therefore, the equation is (83 - 52) + 39 + 24 = 94. </think>
<answer> (83 - 52) + 39 + 24 </answer>

==============
<think> First, add 16 and 61 to get 77. Then subtract 32 from 77 to get 45. Finally, add 78 and 45 to get 123. However, this doesn't equal 91. Let's try another way: Subtract 32 from 61 to get 29. Then add 16 and 29 to get 45. Finally, subtract 78 from 45 to get 77 - 16 = 61. Now, subtract 61 from 78 and add 16 to get the final answer of 91. </think>
<answer> (61 - 16 - 32) + 78 </answer>

==============
<think> Start with the numbers given: 47, 36, and 71. To reach 82, we can subtract 36 from 47 and then add 71. So the expression would be (47 - 36) + 71. Alternatively, we can add 71 to 36 and then subtract 47, which would be 36 + 71 - 47. Both expressions will give us 82. </think>

==============
<think> First, I will subtract 95 from 78 to get 17. Then, I will subtract 17 from 59 to get 42. Finally, I will subtract 42 from 76 to get 0, but since I want to get 76, I will add 59 and 95 and then subtract 78 from the sum. This gives me (59 + 95 - 78) = 76. </think>

<think>First I'll add 63 and 16 to get 79. Then I'll subtract 13 from 79 to get 66. Now I subtract another 13 from 66 to get the final result of 53. So the equation should be 63 + 16 - 13 - 13 = 53. However, I must have made an error because the answer isn't 60. Let me try again. I'll start by adding 63 and 13 to get 76. Then I'll subtract 16 from 76 to get 60. So the correct equation is 63 + 13 - 16 = 60. </think>

==============
<think> First, let's try adding 90 and 39. This gives us 129. Now, we need to subtract 3 from 129 to get 126. But we need an equation that equals 54, not 126. So, let's try subtracting 39 from 90, which gives us 51. Now, we need to subtract 3 from 51, which gives us 48. This is not equal to 54, so let's try adding 3 to 51, which gives us 54. </think>

==============
<think> First, I'll try to add 94 and 84, which is 178. Then, I'll subtract 28 from 178, which is 150. Since 150 is not equal to 18, I won't use this. Next, I'll subtract 94 from 84, which is 90. Then, I'll add 28 to 94, which gives me 122. Finally, I'll subtract 90 from 122, which is 52. Since 52 is not equal to 18, I'll try using all the numbers in a different way. I'll subtract 28 from 94, which is 66. Then, I'll add 84 to 66, which gives me 150. Again, this is not equal to 18. However, if I subtract 84 from 94, which is 10, and then add 28 to 10, I get 38, which is still not equal to 18. I'll try one more way: adding 84 and 28, which is 112. Then, I'll subtract 94 from 112, which gives me 18. This is equal to 18, so the equation is (84 + 28) - 94 = 18. </think>
<answer> (84 + 28) - 94 </answer>

But it doesn't equal 10, so it's not the right answer. Now, I'll try subtracting the numbers instead. I'll subtract 53 from 66 to get 13. Then, I'll subtract 3 from 13 and I'll get 10. So, the equation is 66 - 53 - 3 = 10. </think>

Finally, I'll subtract 84 from 22 to get -62, which is not equal to 38. So, I'll try a different combination. I'll add 82 and 40 to get 122. Then, I'll subtract 84 from 122 to get 38, which is the target number. </think>

Since we need the answer to be 88, we should try another combination. Let's try adding 3 and 55 to get 58. Then, we subtract 58 from 11 to get -47. Finally, we subtract -47 from 88 to get 135. We're not there yet, so let's try another combination. Let's try adding 11 and 55 to get 66. Now, let's subtract 3 from 66 to get 63. And finally, we subtract 63 from 88 to get 25.

We're not there yet, so let's try another combination. Let's try dividing 55 by 11 to get 5. Then, let's add 3 and 11 to get 14. Now, let's multiply 14 by 6 to get 84. Finally, we subtract 84 from 88 to get 4. We're not there yet, so let's try another combination. Let's try multiplying 3 and 11 to get 33. Then, let's add 55 to 33 to get 88. </think>

Finally, add 25 to 73: 73 + 25 = 98, which is still too high. Let's try subtracting 25 from 71: 71 - 25 = 46. Now add 15 to 46: 46 + 15 = 61. Finally, add 13 to 61: 61 + 13 = 74. </think>

<think> First, let's see if we can add 28 and 35 to get 63. Then, we can add 77 to that result to get 140. However, 140 is more than 84, so that won't work. Let's try subtracting 35 from 77 and then add 28. That gives us 42 + 28, which equals 70. That's still more than 84, so let's try subtracting 77 from 35 and then adding 28. That gives us 35 ... - 77 ... which equals -42. Adding 28 to -42 gives us -14, which is not equal to 84. So let's try subtracting 28 from 77 and then adding 35. That gives us 77 ... - 28 ... which equals 49. Adding 35 to 49 gives us 84. Therefore, the correct equation is (77 - 28) + 35 = 84. </think>

<answer> (87 + 57) - 58 </answer>

==============
<think> First, we need to get close to 84 using a combination of the given numbers: 65, 58, 89, and 12. Adding 12 to 65 gives us 77. Then, adding 58 to 77 gives us 135. Finally, subtracting 41 (89 - 58) from 135 gives us 95. However, 95 is too high. Instead, let's try subtracting 95 - 41, which equals 54. Now, we can add 12 to 54 to get 66. But we need 84, so let's try subtracting 66 - 41, which equals 25. Then, we subtract 25 - 12, which equals 13. This is not correct. Let's try another approach: 89 + 58 - 65 + 12. This simplifies to 155 - 65 + 12, which equals 98 - 12, which equals 86. This is also not correct. The correct approach is to add 65 to 89, which equals 154. Then, subtract 58, which equals 96. Finally, subtract 12, which equals 84. </think>
<answer> (65 + 89) - 58 - 12 </answer>

<think> First, let's try to add 8 and 34: 8 + 34 = 42. Then, subtract 76 from 42: 42 - 76 = -34. However, this does not give us 50. Let's try another approach. We can try to add 76 and 34: 76 + 34 = 110. Then, subtract 8 from 110: 110 - 8 = 102. This also does not give us 50. Finally, we can try to subtract 8 from 34: 34 - 8 = 26. Then, add 76 to 26: 76 + 26 = 102. Again, this does not give us 50. After trying several combinations, we can try to add 8 and 76: 8 + 76 = 84. Then, subtract 34 from 84: 84 - 34 = 50. Now we have an equation that equals 50: 8 + 76 - 34 = 50. </think>

<think> First, let's add 81 and 34. That gives us 115. Since 115 is close to 100, let's subtract 15 from it to get exactly 100. So the equation is (81 + 34) - 15 = 100. </think>
<answer> (81 + 34) - 15 </answer>

==============
<think>First, I'll try to add 43 and 3. That gives me 46. Then, I'll subtract 31 from 46 to get 15. However, 15 is not equal to 50. Now, I'll try to multiply 43 by 3. That gives me 129. Since 129 is not equal to 50, I'll try to subtract 31 from 129. That gives me 98. Again, 98 is not equal to 50, so my final attempt is to subtract 3 from 98. That gives me 95, which is still not equal to 50. The closest I got was 46 - 31 = 15, but to reach 50, I'll have to change my approach. Instead, I'll try to add 31 to 43 and then subtract 4. 43 + 31 = 74, and 74 - 4 = 70. Since 70 is still not equal to 50, I'll subtract 3 from 70. 70 - 3 = 67. Now, to get to 50, I'll subtract 7 from 67. 67 - 7 = 60, which is still not 50. The closest I came was 74 - 7 = 67, but to get to 50, I'll have to try another method. Since the options seem limited, I'll try to see if I can use the numbers in different orders or combination. Let's try 31 multiplied by 3 becomes 93, then add 43 to get 136. 136 - 86 does not lead to 50. My closest attempt was 74 - 7 = 67, but to get to 50, I'll have to try another method. Let's try 43 multiplied by 3 becomes 129, then subtract 79. 129 - 79 is not leading to 50. Let's try adding 3 to 43, then subtract 73. 3 + 43 = 46, then 46 - 73 = -27. That does not lead to 50. Let's try 31 multiplied by 3 becomes 93, then subtract 43. 93 - 43 = 50. </think>

==============
<think> First, we have the numbers 77, 53, and 75. To get to 55, we can subtract 53 from 77, which gives us 24. Then we can add 75 to the result, which gives us 99. However, this isn't equal to 55. So let's try another combination. If we subtract 77 from 75, we get -2. Then adding 53 to -2, we get 51, still not 55. Let's try one more combination. When we subtract 53 from 75, we get 22, and then adding 77 to obtain 99. This isn't equal to 55. I believe we haven't reached the correct solution. Well, let me go back to the first combination. When we subtract 53 from 77, we get 24, and then adding 53 to get 77. Oh, now it seems like I've made an error. The answer should be (77 + 53 - 75 = 55) or (53 + 77 - 75 = 55). </think>

<think> First, let's try subtracting the smallest number, 28, from the next smallest, 58. Then, we can add that result to the largest number, 87. (58 - 28) + 87 = 30 + 87 = 117. However, this doesn't equal 57, so let's try combining the middle two numbers. (58 + 28) - 87 = 86 - 87 = -1. This also doesn't equal 57, so we need to try a different combination. Adding the smallest and largest together and then subtracting the middle one, ((87 + 28) - 58) = 115 - 58 = 57. </think>

That gives me 118. Then, I'll subtract 37 from 118, which will give me 81. Still not 61. Lastly, I'll add 37 to 71 and then subtract 47. That gives me 41. Still not 61. </think>

<think> To reach 79 using the numbers 20, 79, and 20, I can start by subtracting 20 from 79, which gives me 59. Then, I can add 20 to 59, which equals 79. </think>
<answer> (79 - 20) + 20 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll add 20 and 81 to get 101. Then, I'll subtract 2 from 101 to get 99. Finally, I'll realize that I need to subtract 6 from 99 to get 93, but that doesn't equal 63. So, I'll try another combination: subtract 20 from 81 and then add 20 to that result. This gives me 61, which is too high. Next, I'll try subtracting 2 from 81 and then adding 2 to that result. This gives me 79, which is close but still not 63. One more try: add 2 to 20 and then subtract 81 from that result. This gives me 0, which is not equal to 63. I'll try one more combination: add 2 to 81 and then subtract 20 from that result. This gives me 61, which is too high. </think>

==============
<think> First, we can try adding 40 and 98 to get 138. Then, we subtract 77 from 138 to get 61. So, the equation is 40 + 98 - 77 = 61. </think>
<answer> (40 + 98) - 77 </answer>

==============
<think>First, I'll try to add the largest numbers. 
29 + 36 = 65. 
Now, I'll subtract the smallest number, 4, from the result. 
65 - 4 = 61. 
Finally, I'll add the remaining number, 28, to get the final answer. 
61 + 28 = 89. 
However, this gives me 89, which is not equal to 39. 
So, I'll try another combination. 
Now, I'll add 36 and 4. 
36 + 4 = 40. 
Then, I'll add the remaining number, 28. 
40 + 28 = 68. 
This gives me 68, which is not equal to 39. 
I'll try one more combination. 
Now, I'll add 29 and 4. 
29 + 4 = 33. 
Then, I'll add the remaining number, 36. 
33 + 36 = 69. 
This also gives me 69, which is not equal to 39. 
Finally, I'll subtract 4 from 29. 
29 - 4 = 25. 
Then, I'll add the remaining number, 36. 
25 + 36 = 61. 
This gives me 61, which is not equal to 39. So, I need to check my work again. 
I'll try to subtract 28 from 36. 
36 - 28 = 8. 
Then, I'll add the remaining number, 29. 
8 + 29 = 37. 
This gives me 37, which is not equal to 39. 
Finally, I'll subtract 29 from 36. 
36 - 29 = 7. 
Then, I'll add the remaining number, 28. 
7 + 28 = 35. 
This gives me 35, which is not equal to 39. 
Last, I'll subtract 28 from 36. 
36 - 28 = 8. 
Then, I'll add the remaining number, 29. 
8 + 29 = 37. 
This gives me 37, which is not equal to 39. </think>

<think> First, let's consider adding 11 and 22 to get 33. Then, add 33 to 39 to get 52. To reach 72, we need to add 20 more. So, the equation is (11 + 22) + 39 = 72. </think>

<think> First, let's consider adding 13 and 41 to reach 54. Since we need 30, we can subtract 27 from 54. However, 27 isn't directly a combination of 2, 13, and 41. So, let's try subtracting 13 from 41 first to get 28, and then add 2 to achieve 30. </think>
<answer> (41 - 13) + 2 </answer>

==============

<think> First, I can add 27 and 58 to get 85. Then, I can subtract 22 from 85 to get 63. Finally, I can subtract 46 from 63 to get 17. However, 17 is not equal to 55. So, I need to try a different combination of numbers. Let's try subtracting 27 from 58 first. That gives me 31. If I then subtract 22 from 31, I get 9. Adding 46 to 9 gives me 55. So, the equation is 58 - 27 - 22 + 46 = 55. </think>

==============
<think> First, let's add 82 and 51 to get 133. Then, subtract 16 from 133 to get 117. Since we want the result to be 15, we need to subtract 102 from 133 to get 31. However, 31 is too high, so let's try a different approach. We can subtract 16 from 82 to get 66, and then add 51 to get 117. Since 117 is too high, let's try subtracting 117 from 160 (82 + 51) to get 43. Since 43 is still too high, let's try subtracting 82 from 160 to get 78. Now, let's subtract 51 from 78 to get 27. This is still not equal to 15, so let's try adding 16 to 27 to get 43. Since 43 is still too high, let's try subtracting 51 from 43 to get -18. Since we can't use negative numbers, let's try subtracting 16 from 82 to get 66. Now, let's subtract 51 from 66 to get 15. </think>

<think> First, I notice that I can use all the numbers to try different operations to get the result. I should start with 55 - 32, which gives me 23. Then, I add 1 to 23 to get 24. However, 24 is not equal to 22. Then, I try 55 - 32 - 1, which gives me 22. This is the equation I'm looking for. </think>

==============
<think> First, I will add 29 and 2. This gives 31. Then, I will add 69 to 31, which results in 100. However, 100 is not equal to 42. Next, I will try subtracting 69 from 29, which equals -40. Not 42. Alternatively, I can multiply 29 by 2, which is 58. Still not 42. Multiplying 69 by 2 gives 138, which is also not 42. Using all operations once, I can subtract 2 from 69 and then add 29, which equals 76. Lastly, I can subtract 76 from 100, giving me 24. It seems I cannot create an equation equaling 42 using these numbers and operations only once. I might have to rethink my strategy. </think>

Let me try subtracting 84 from 168 instead of adding 40, so I'll get 84. Now, if I add 21 and 8, I get 29, which is still too high. Let me try subtracting 40 from 168 instead of adding 84, so I'll get 128. Now, if I add 21 and 8, I get 29, which is still too high. Finally, I'll try adding 84 and 21, and then subtracting 40 and 8, so I get 84 + 21 - 40 - 8 = 67, which is still too high. </think>

<think> First, let's see if we can get close to 30 by using addition or subtraction. Adding 51 and 73 gives us 124. This is too high. Subtracting 8 from 51 gives us 43. This is also too high. Now, let's try doing 73 minus 51, which is 22. This is still high. We can try adding 8 to 22, which gives us 30. So, the equation is (73 - 51) + 8. </think>

This is too large, so I'll subtract 14 to get 74. Still not 18, so I need to try another approach. I'll try subtracting 42 and 14 to get 28. Finally, I'll subtract 46 from 28 to get -18, which isn't correct. Let's try another combination: I'll add 14 and 46 to get 60. Then, I'll subtract 42 to get 18. </think>

Let me try 92 plus 25 equals 117, and then subtract 28 from that to get 89. Unfortunately, that's still not correct. Last, let me try subtracting 68 from 92, which gives me 24. And finally, add 25 and 28 to get 53. That's not the right answer either. Lastly, I'll try subtracting 68 from 25, which gives me -43. And finally, adding 92 and 28 will give me 120. That's not the correct answer either. Ok, lastly, let me try adding 92 and 25, which gives me 117. Now I can subtract 28 from that to get 90. I'll subtract 68 from 90, and that gives me 22.

<think> First, let's try adding 75 and 34 to get 109. Then, we can subtract 71 from 109 to get 38. Finally, we can add 92 to 38 to get 130. However, this does not equal 62. Let's try subtracting 71 from 75 instead of adding it. This gives us 4. Then, we subtract 34 from 4, which gives us -30. This also does not equal 62. Now, let's try adding 75 and 71 to get 146. Then, we can subtract 92 from 146 to get 54. This still does not equal 62. Finally, let's try subtracting 34 from 75 to get 41. Then, we can subtract 71 from 41 to get -30. This is not equal to 62 either. </think>
<answer> (75 - 34) - 71 + 92 </answer>

==============
<think>First, let's add 75 and 34 to get 109. Then, subtract 71 from 109 to get 38. Finally, add 92 to 38 to get 130, which is not equal to 62. Adding 92 to 109 gives us 201, which is not equal to 62 either. If we subtract 92 from 109, we get 17. Now, adding 75 and 17 gives us 92, which is not equal to 62. So, none of these simple operations work. Let's try subtraction first: 75 - 34 = 41. Then subtract 71 from 41 - 92 = 72. Adding 92 to 72 gives us 164, which is not equal to 62. Adding 92 to 41 gives us 133, which is not equal to 62. If we subtract 92 from 41, we get -51. Adding 75 to -51 gives us 24. Now, subtract 71 from 24 gives us -47, which is not equal to 62. Multiplication: 75 * 34 = 2550. This is too big, so let's try dividing 75 by 34 and then multiplying by 71 and 92. 75 / 34 = 2.2058823529411765. Multiplying this by 71 gives us 158.23529411764706. Multiplying this by 92 gives us 14385.76923076923, which is not equal to 62. However, we can try subtracting 92 from this result: 14385.76923076923 - 92 = 14293.76923076923. This is not 62 either. Let's try another approach: 75 - (34 + 71) = -30. Adding 92 to -30 gives us 62. So the equation is (75 - (34 + 71)) + 92 = 62. </think>

I will subtract 9 from 65 to get 56. Then, I will add 20 to 56 to get 76. Finally, I will subtract 26 from 76 to get 50. Still, 50 is not equal to 62. I will try one more approach. I will subtract 9 from 20 to get 11. Then, I will add 65 to 11 to get 76. Finally, I will add 26 to 76 to get 102. 102 is not equal to 62 either. It seems that no combination of these three numbers using basic arithmetic operations can result in 62. </think>

<answer> (85 - 56) + 60 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's try to add the first two numbers: 67 + 65 = 132. This is close to our target of 95, but not quite there. Now, let's subtract the third number: 132 - 37 = 95. This is the equation we're looking for. </think>
<answer> (67 + 65) - 37 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll add 23 and 23 to get 46. Then, I'll add 51 to 46 which gives me 97. </think>
<answer> (23 + 23) + 51 </answer>

==============
<think> Start with 53 and 8. 53 - 8 equals 45. Now add 36 to the result: 45 + 36 equals 81. Finally, add 12 to get the final result: 81 + 12 equals 93. However, this does not equal 85. Let's try another combination. Add 8 to 36 first: 8 + 36 equals 44. Now add 12: 44 + 12 equals 56. This is still not 85. The equation (53 - 8) + (36 + 12) equals 53 - 8 + 44 equals 99, which is also incorrect. It seems like I need to try different combinations. I remember another approach I could use. Multiply 8 by 12: 8 * 12 equals 96. Now subtract 36: 96 - 36 equals 60. Subtract 53 from this result: 60 - 53 equals 7. This is not equal to 85 either. It's clear that none of these combinations work. I should use a different strategy. I'll add 53 and 36: 53 + 36 equals 89. Then subtract 12: 89 - 12 equals 77. Finally, add 8 to get the final result: 77 + 8 equals 85. </think>
<answer> (53 + 36) - 12 + 8 </answer>

==============
<think>First, let's try to add the largest number to the sum of the other two. 53 + 36 = 89. Then, we can add 8 to get closer to 85: 89 + 8 = 97. We need to subtract 12 to reach 85: 97 - 12 = 85.</think>
<answer> (53 + 36) + 8 - 12 </answer>

==============
<think> First let's add 56 and 57. 56 + 57 = 113. Now we have to subtract 59 from 113. 113 - 59 = 54. However, 54 is not equal to 58. So, let's try another combination. Subtract 56 from 59. 59 - 56 = 3. Now add 57 to 3. 57 + 3 = 60. But 60 is not 58 either. We need to try a different approach. Add 56 and 57. 56 + 57 = 113. Now subtract 113 from 59. 59 - 113 = -54. This is not correct. Finally, let's try adding 56 and 59 to get 115. Then subtract 57 from 115. 115 - 57 = 58. This works. </think>
<answer> (56 + 59) - 57 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's try to add 24 to 71, which gives us 95. However, 95 is too high. Then, let's subtract 51 from 71, which gives us 20. Now, if we add 24 to 20, we get 44. </think>
<answer> (71 - 51) + 24 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's see if we can get 74 by adding the three numbers together. If not, we'll try combinations of the numbers with subtraction. Let's start with addition: 49 + 62 = 111, which is too high. Now, let's try subtraction: 62 - 37 = 25, and 49 + 25 = 74.</think>
<answer> (62 - 37) + 49 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I can add 62 and 58 to get 120. Then, I can subtract 37 from that result to get 83. Finally, I can add 30 to 83 to get 113, which is not equal to 71. So, let me try another combination: Add 62 and 37 to get 99. Then subtract 58 from that result to get 41. Finally, add 30 to 41 to get 71. </think>
<answer> (62 + 37) - 58 + 30 </answer>

<answer> (98 - 74) + 64 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider adding 98 and 74, which equals 172. Then, subtracting 64 from 172 would give us 108. However, this doesn't equal 88. Next, let's try subtracting 98 from 74, which gives us -24. Then, subtracting 64 from -24 would result in -88. This doesn't equal 88 either. Finally, let's try adding 98 and 64, which equals 162. Then, subtracting 74 from 162 would give us 88. </think>

<think> First, let's try combining the largest numbers: 61 + 25 = 86. Then, we can add 45 to get 86 + 45 = 131. Finally, we subtract 34 from 131 to get 131 - 34 = 97. </think>
<answer> (61 + 25) + 45 - 34 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll try adding 34 and 22 together to get 56. Then I'll subtract 37 from 56, which gives me 19. However, 19 is not equal to 25. Next, I'll try adding 22 and 37 together to get 59. Then I'll subtract 34 from 59, which gives me 25. So, the equation is 22 + 37 - 34 = 25. </think>

==============
<think> First, I'll try adding 55 and 15. That gives me 70. Now, if I add 16 to 70, I get 86. That's not 24, so that doesn't work. Next, I'll try subtracting 16 from 55. That gives me 39. Now, if I add 15 to 39, I get 54. Still not 24. I'll try dividing 55 by 16. That gives me 3.4375, which is not a whole number, so that won't work either. I'll try multiplying 55 and 15. That gives me 825. Now, if I subtract 16 from 825, I get 809. That's too big. I'll try dividing 55 by 16. That gives me 3.4375, which I can't use. I'll try subtracting 15 from 55. That gives me 40. Now, if I subtract 16 from 40, I get 24. That's the answer I'm looking for! </think>

==============
<think> First, let's try adding 43 and 27: 43 + 27 = 70. Now, subtract 33 from 70 to get 37: 70 - 33 = 37. So the equation is (43 + 27) - 33 = 37. </think>
<answer> (43 + 27) - 33 </answer>

<think> First, I'll try to add 38 and 20 to get 58, which is not equal to 57. Next, I'll try to subtract 1 from 38 to get 37, and then add 20 to that to get 57. So, the equation is 38 - 1 + 20. </think>
<answer> (38 - 1) + 20 </answer>

==============
<think> First, we can add 16 and 19 to get 35. Then, we can add 61 to 35 to get 66. However, this is not equal to 99. Next, let's try subtracting 3 from 61, which gives us 58. Adding 35 to 58 gives us 93, which is closer to 99. Finally, we can add 6 to 93 to get 100, which is still not equal to 99. However, if we subtract 1 from 61, we get 60, and adding 35 to 60 gives us 95. Adding 6 to 95 gives us 101, which is too high. Trying another combination, we can add 16 to 19 to get 35, and then subtract 58 from 35, which gives us -23. Adding 60 to -23 gives us 37, which is still not equal to 99. Finally, we can add 16 to 61, which gives us 77. Adding 19 to 77 gives us 96. Adding 3 to 96 gives us 99, which is the correct answer. </think>

Finally, I'll subtract 48 from 30 to get -8. This doesn't equal 18 either. I'll try adding 23 and 48 to get 71. Then, I'll subtract 53 from 71 to get 18. This is the correct equation. </think>

<think>First, I'll add 56 and 28 to get 84. Then, I'll add 62 to 84 to get 146. This is too large, so I'll try subtracting 84 from 62 to get -22. Since we can't have negative numbers in this equation, I'll try subtracting 84 from 28 instead, which gives me -56. Adding 56 to -56 gives me 0, which is not equal to 90. Finally, I'll try subtracting 28 from 62, which gives me 34. Adding 56 to 34 gives me 90, which is what we want.</think>

<think> First, let's try adding 35 and 92. That gives us 127. This isn't equal to 65, so we need to subtract something from 127. Let's try subtracting 62, which gives us 65. </think>

<answer> (35 + 92) - 62 </answer>

==============
<think>First, let's see if we can add some numbers to get closer to 65. By adding 35 and 92, we get 127. That's too high. Now, let's try subtracting 35 from 92 and then adding 62. That gives us 92 - 35 = 57, and then 57 + 62 = 119. Oh, that's still too high. What about if we subtract 62 from 92 and then add 35? That gives us 92 - 62 = 30, and then 30 + 35 = 65. That's right! </think>

==============
<think> First, I'll add 80 and 63, which gives me 143. Then, I'll subtract 84 from 143, which gives me 59. So the equation is: (80 + 63) - 84. </think>

==============
<think> First, I'll try to add the largest numbers together. 30 + 32 equals 62, which is close to 61. Now, I'll subtract 1 from 62 to get 61. So, the equation is (30 + 32) - 1 = 61. </think>
<answer> (30 + 32) - 1 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll try to add the smallest number to the largest number, which gives me 60 + 41 = 101. This is too big, so I'll subtract the smallest number from the middle number: 60 - 36 = 24. Now I have 24 + 41 = 65. </think>
<answer> (60 - 36) + 41 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll add 36 and 60 to get 96. Then, I'll subtract 41 from 96 to get 55. Now, I'll add the two remaining numbers, 41 and 50, to get 91. However, this doesn't equal 65. Let me try another combination. If I add 41 and 60, I get 101. Then, if I subtract 36 from 101, I get 65. </think>
<answer> (41 + 60) - 36 </answer>

<think> First, let's try adding 62 and 19. That gives us 81. Now, if we subtract 64 from 81, we get 17. So the equation would be (62 + 19) - 64. </think>
<answer> (62 + 19) - 64 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's try adding 45 and 77 to see if we can get close to 20. That gives us 45 + 77 = 122. That's too big. Next, let's subtract 122 by 52 to see if we can get closer to 20. That gives us 122 - 52 = 70. Finally, let's subtract 70 by 45 and 77. That gives us 70 - 45 - 77 = -52. Now let's try adding 52 and 45 and subtracting 77. That gives us 52 + 45 - 77 = 19. So the final equation is (52 + 45) - 77 = 20. </think>

Let me add 8 and 10: 8 + 10 = 18. Then, I'll add 15 to it: 18 + 15 = 33. Finally, I'll subtract 71 from it: 33 - 71 = -38. Still doesn't work. I'll try adding 8 and 15: 8 + 15 = 23. Then, I'll add 10 to it: 23 + 10 = 33. Finally, I'll subtract 71 from it: 33 - 71 = -38. I still don't have the right answer. Let me add 71 and 10: 71 + 10 = 81. Then, I'll subtract 15 from it: 81 - 15 = 66. Something doesn't look right, but let me try adding 10 and 8: 10 + 8 = 18. Then, I'll subtract 15 from it: 18 - 15 = 3. Finally, I'll add 71 to it: 71 + 3 = 74. Nope, that's too high. Okay, let me try adding 15 and 8: 15 + 8 = 23. Then, I'll add 10 to it: 23 + 10 = 33. Finally, I'll add 71 to it: 33 + 71 = 104. That doesn't work either. I must have been thinking too hard. </think>

==============
<think>First, let's see if we can combine the numbers to get a value close to 98. Adding 47 and 23 gives us 70. Since 70 is not enough to reach 98, we can subtract 28 from it. This gives us 70 - 28 = 42. Now, we have 42 left to reach 98. Adding 28 to 42 will give us 70, which is the difference between 98 and 42. So, the equation will be (47 + 23 + 28).</think>

<think> First, I'll try to use the third number, 28, as the result of an addition. I know that 47 + 23 is too large, so I'll try 47 - 23 = 24. Then, I'll add 28 to 24 to get 52. But I need to get to 98, so I'll add 28 again to get 80. However, I can do better by adding 28 to 47 to get 75, and then adding 23 to get 98. </think>
<answer> (47 + 28) + 23 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll try to find a combination of two numbers that when added to the third number equal 98. Adding 47 and 23 gives 67, and adding this result to 28 gives 95. This is close but not quite 98. Next, I'll try adding the two larger numbers together, 23 and 28, which equals 51. Adding this result to 47 gives 98. </think>

<think> First, I'll try to use multiplication and subtraction. 13 x 2 = 26. Then, I'll subtract 97 from that result: 26 - 97 = -71. This doesn't work because the result is negative. Next, I'll try using multiplication and addition. 13 x 2 = 26. Then, 26 + 97 = 123. This doesn't work either because it's too big. Now, I'll try using addition and subtraction. 2 + 13 = 15. Then, 15 + 97 = 112. This is still too big. Lastly, I'll try using addition and subtraction again but in a different order. 97 + 2 = 99. Then, 99 - 13 = 86. This works because it equals 86. </think>

Next, I'll subtract 70 from 139 and add 28. This gives me 97, which is the correct answer. </think>

<think>First, let's try adding 64 and 37: 64 + 37 = 101. But this doesn't equal 53. Next, let's try adding 64 and 26: 64 + 26 = 90. Still not 53. Now, let's try subtracting 37 from 64: 64 - 37 = 27. That still doesn't equal 53. Finally, let's try subtracting 26 from 64: 64 - 26 = 38. This is not 53 either. Then, let's try adding 37 and 26: 37 + 26 = 63. That still doesn't equal 53. But if we add them and subtract 26 at the same time, it might work: (37 + 26) - 26 = 63 - 26 = 37. Hmmm, that didn't work. So, I guess I need to try a different combination. Let me think for a moment... Ah! I remember now. Let's subtract 26 from 64 and then add 37: 64 - 26 + 37 = 48 + 37 = 85. That's not 53. Wait, what if I add 37 to 64 and then subtract 26: 64 + 37 - 26 = 101 - 26 = 75. Nope. Let's reverse it: 64 - 37 + 26 = 27 + 26 = 53. Ah-ha! This works! </think>

<think> First, let's add 37 and 96, which equals 133. Then, let's subtract 73 from 133, which equals 60. However, this doesn't equal 14. Next, let's try subtracting 96 from 37, which equals -59. Then, let's subtract 73 from -59, which equals -132. This also doesn't equal 14. Finally, let's try adding 37 and 73, which equals 110. Then, let's subtract 96 from 110, which equals 14. So the equation is 37 + 73 - 96 = 14. </think>

<think> First, I'll try to add 81 and 77. That gives me 158. Then, I'll subtract 56 from 158 to get 102. However, this doesn't equal 52. Next, I'll add 81 and 56, which equals 137. Then, I'll subtract 77 from 137 to get 60. Still not 52. Let me try another combination. I'll add 77 and 56, which gives me 133. Then, I'll subtract 81 from 133 to get 52. That's the correct answer! </think>
<answer> (77 + 56) - 81 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I will try to add the two smallest numbers, 17 and 49, to get 66. Then, if I add the third number, 62, to 66, I get 128, which is more than 94. That means 62 + 17 + 49 is not the correct equation. Next, I will try subtracting the smallest number, 17, from 62, which gives me 45. Then, if I add 49 to 45, I get 94. </think>
<answer> 62 + 49 - 17 </answer>

<think> First, I'll add 96 and 33 to get 129. Then, I'll subtract 72 from 129 to get 57. </think>
<answer> (96 + 33) - 72 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's try to add 69 and 62. That gives us 131. Now, if we subtract 81 from 131, we get 50. So, the equation is (69 + 62) - 81 = 50. </think>
<answer> (69 + 62) - 81 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll look for a combination that might add up to 40. Adding 56 and 29 gives me 85, which is too much. Subtracting 29 from 56 gives me 27. Now, if I subtract 27 from 45, I get 18. So, the equation is 56 - (45 - 29).</think>
<answer> (56 - (45 - 29)) </answer>

<think> First, I'll start by trying to add 26 and 30. That gives me 56. Then, I'll add 21 to 56. That equals 77. </think>
<answer> 26 + 30 + 21 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's try to add the numbers 16 and 60 to get 76. Then, we can subtract 96 from 76 to get 10. However, 10 is not equal to 20. Next, let's try subtracting 16 from 60 to get 44. Then, we can subtract 96 from 44 to get -52. This also does not equal 20. Now, let's try adding 16 and 96 to get 112. Then, we can subtract 60 from 112 to get 52. Still not equal to 20. Finally, let's try subtracting 60 from 96 to get 36. Then, we can subtract 16 from 36 to get 20. </think>

<think> First, I'll try to add 24 and 9 which equals 33. Then, I'll add 60 to 33 which equals 93. However, this is not equal to 75. Next, I'll try to subtract 60 from 24 which is not possible since 60 is larger than 24. I'll try another approach by subtracting 9 from 24 which equals 15. Then, I'll add 60 to 15 which equals 75. </think>
<answer> (24 - 9) + 60 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I notice that if I add 78 and 58, I get 136. Then if I subtract 65 from 136, I get 71. However, 71 is not equal to 85. Next, if I add 78 and 65, I get 143. If I subtract 58 from 143, I get 85. </think>
<answer> (78 + 65) - 58 </answer>

==============
<think>First, I'll try to add 79 and 53. That gives me 132. Now, if I subtract 95 from 132, I get 37. That's not 69. Next, let me try subtracting 53 from 79. That gives me 26. Now, if I subtract 95 from 26, I get -69. That's not 69 either. However, I can add 95 to 79 and then subtract 53. That gives me 121 - 53 = 68. That's still not 69. But if I add 95 to 79 and then add 53, that gives me 174 + 53 = 227. That's not 69. However, I can subtract 53 from 79 and then add 95. That gives me 26 + 95 = 121. That's still not 69. But if I subtract 53 from 95 and then add 79, that gives me 42 + 79 = 121. That's still not 69. Finally, I can try subtracting 79 from 95 and then adding 53. That gives me 16 + 53 = 69. That's exactly what I need!</think>

<think> Adding 14 and 23 gives me 37. Then I add 89 to 37, which equals 126. However, this doesn't give me 52. If I subtract 37 from 89, I get 52. </think>
<answer> 89 - (14 + 23) </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's see if we can add 25 and 17 to get 42. Then, we need 5 more to reach 49, so we should add 49 to our result. This gives us 42 + 17 + 49 = 108, which is not equal to 57. Next, let's try 25 + 49 = 74, and then add 17 to that, which gives us 74 + 17 = 91, which is not equal to 57. Now, let's try 25 - 17 = 8, and then add 49 to that, which gives us 8 + 49 = 57. This is the correct equation because it equals 57. </think>
<answer> (25 - 17) + 49 </answer>

==============
<think>First, I will try to add 25 and 17: 25 + 17 = 42. Then, I will add 49 to 42: 42 + 49 = 91. However, this doesn't equal 57. Next, I will try subtracting 17 from 25: 25 - 17 = 8. Finally, I will add 49 to 8: 8 + 49 = 57. This equals 57.</think>

==============
<think> First, I'll try to add 84 and 82, which gives me 166. Then, I'll subtract 23 from 166, which equals 143. However, this doesn't equal 21. Next, I'll try subtracting 84 and 82, which equals -16, and then adding 23, which equals -13. Still not equal to 21. Now, I'll try multiplying 84 by 23, which equals 1932, and then subtracting 82, which equals 1850. Not equal to 21. Let me try another combination: subtract 82 from 84, which equals 2, and then add 23, which equals 25. Not equal to 21. Finally, I'll try adding 82 and 23, which equals 105, and then subtracting 84, which equals 21. This satisfies the condition.</think>

==============
<think> First, let's try to add the two largest numbers, 48 and 46. That gives us 94. Now, let's subtract 19 from 94, which equals 75. However, 75 is too large. So, I'll try subtracting 46 and then adding 19. That gives us 46 - 19 = 27. Now, let's subtract 48 from 27, which is not possible. Next, I'll try subtracting 19 and then adding 46. That gives us 19 + 46 = 65. Now, let's subtract 48 from 65, which equals 17. </think>
<answer> (46 + 19) - 48 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's see if we can combine the numbers directly: 30 + 91 + 91 will give us 212, which is not 30. Next, let's try subtracting 91 from 30 to get -61, then adding 91 to get 30. This gives us the equation 30 - 91 + 91 = 30. </think>
<answer> 30 - 91 + 91 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll try to add 75 and 43, which gives me 118. Then I'll add 54 to that, giving me 172. But that's more than 86, so that won't work. Next, I'll try subtracting the smaller numbers. Subtracting 75 and 54 gives me -29, and then subtracting 43 would be a really large negative number, also not equal to 86. Finally, I'll try adding 75 to 54, which gives me 129. Then I'll subtract 43 from that, which gives me 86, which is what I'm looking for. </think>
<answer> (75 + 54) - 43 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I might add 82 and 51, which equals 133. Then, I can subtract 40 from 133 to get 93. However, this does not equal 71. Another possibility is to subtract 40 from 82 and then add 51, which equals 93. Again, this does not work. So, I will try adding 82 and 40, which equals 122. Then, I can subtract 51 from 122 to get 71. This works! </think>
<answer> (82 + 40) - 51 </answer>

==============
<think> First I will add 82 and 51 to get 133. Then I will subtract 40 from 133 to get 93. Since 93 is not equal to 71, I will try subtracting 40 from 82, which gives me 42. Adding 51 to 42 gives me 93, which is still not equal to 71. I will try adding 51 to 40, which gives me 91. Adding 82 to 91 gives me 173, which is not equal to 71. I will try subtracting 82 from 51, which gives me -31. Adding 40 to -31 gives me -1, which is not equal to 71. Finally, I will try adding 40 to 40, which gives me 80. Adding 82 to 80 gives me 162, which is not equal to 71. </think>

<think> First, we add 64 and 33 to get 97. Then, we subtract 1 from 97 to get 96. So the equation is (64 + 33) - 1. </think>
<answer> (64 + 33) - 1 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I can add 88 and 53 to get 141. Then, I can subtract 86 from 141 to get 55. But 55 doesn't equal 51, so that doesn't work. Next, I can try subtracting 86 from 88 to get 2, and then adding 53 to get 55. Again, 55 doesn't equal 51. Finally, I can try adding 88 and 86 to get 174, and then subtracting 53 to get 121. Still not 51. I need to try a different approach. Perhaps I can try adding 86 and 53 to get 139, and then subtracting 88 to get 51. </think>

==============
<think>First, let's see if we can combine the numbers to get 63. We can try subtracting 39 from 68. That gives us 29. Then we can add 44 to that, which gives us 73. That's too high. Let's try adding 39 to 44, which gives us 83. That's also too high. Now let's try subtracting 44 from 68, which gives us 24. Then we can add 39 to that, which gives us 63. That's the correct answer! </think>
<answer> (68 - 44) + 39 </answer>

==============
<think> First, we can try adding 36 and 67. That gives us 103, which is too large for 23. Next, let's try subtracting 8 from 36. That gives us 28. Then, we can subtract 67 from 28. However, that would give us -39, which is not equal to 23. Let's try adding 8 to 36 instead. That gives us 44. Then, we can subtract 67 from 44. However, that would give us -23, which is not equal to 23. Finally, let's try adding 67 and 8. That gives us 75. We still haven't reached 23, so this equation isn't working. Lastly, we can try subtracting 8 from 67. That gives us 59. Then, we can subtract 36 from 59. The result is 23. </think>
<answer> (67 - 8) - (36) </answer>

==============
<think> I have three numbers: 75, 26, and 11. I need to create an equation that equals 90. First, I can add 75 and 26, which equals 101. Then, I can subtract 11 from 101, which equals 90. </think>
<answer> (75 + 26) - 11 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll try to combine the given numbers with basic arithmetic operations to get the desired result. I see that 41 - 6 = 35. Then, 46 + 41 = 87. Since 75 is closer to 87, I'll try to subtract 64 from 87 to get 23. Then, I'll add 35 to 23 to get 58. However, this doesn't give me the desired result. Next, I'll try to add 64 to 46 to get 110. Then, I'll subtract 41 from 110 to get 69. Finally, I'll add 6 to 69 to get 75. </think>
<answer> (64 + 46) - 41 + 6 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll try to add 48 and 2 to get 50. Then, I'll add 21 to the result to get 71. But 71 is not 75, so this combination is not correct. Next, I'll try to multiply 48 and 2 to get 96. Then, I'll subtract 21 from the result to get 75. This combination works </think>
<answer> (48 * 2) - 21 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll try adding 15 and 13 which equals 28. Then, I'll add 49 to 28 which equals 77. That's not the number 47 we want. Now, let me try subtracting 13 from 49 which equals 36. Then, I'll subtract 15 from 36 which equals 21. Still not the number 47. Next, I'll try subtracting 49 from 15 which doesn't make sense as it would be negative. I'll try subtracting 15 from 49 which equals 34. Then, I'll subtract 13 from 34 which equals 21. That's still not the number 47. I'll try adding 49 and 13 which equals 62. Then, I'll subtract 15 from 62 which equals 47. This looks like the correct equation. </think>
<answer> (49 + 13) - 15 </answer>

<think> First, I'll try to add 71 and 90 to get 161. Then, I can subtract 7 from 161 to get 154. Finally, I need to subtract 75 from 154 to get 79. However, 79 is not equal to 26. So let's try another combination. I'll subtract 7 from 71 to get 64. Then, I'll add 90 to 64 to get 154. Now, if I subtract 75 from 154, I get 79 again. This doesn't work either. I need to try adding 7 and 90 first, to get 97. Then, I'll subtract 71 from 97 to get 26. </think>
<answer> (90 + 7) - 71 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll add the numbers: 71 + 7 = 78. Then, I'll subtract 90 from the result: 78 - 90 = -12. This doesn't give me the desired result of 26. Instead, let me try another approach. I'll add 90 to 71: 90 + 71 = 161. Then, I'll subtract 7 from the result: 161 - 7 = 154. Still not 26. Let me try one more combination. I'll add 7 and 90: 7 + 90 = 97. Then, I'll subtract 71 from the result: 97 - 71 = 26. This gives me the desired result of 26. </think>

<think> First, let's try to use addition: 23 + 69 = 92, which is too high. Then, let's try subtraction: 69 - 23 = 46. Now, we have 46 and 10, which also give us a high result. Let's try another combination: 69 - 10 = 59, which is still too high. Finally, let's try multiplication: 23 * 10 = 230, which is also too high. Now, let's try one more combination: 69 - (23 - 10) = 69 - 13 = 56. So, the equation is 69 - (23 - 10). </think>
<answer> (69 - 23) + 10 </answer>

==============
<think> We need to use the numbers 23, 69, and 10 to get 56. Adding 23 and 69 gives us 92. Subtracting 10 from 92 gives us 82, which is not 56. We try another combination: adding 69 and 10 gives us 79. Subtracting 23 from 79 gives us 56. </think>

<answer> (69 - 23) + 10 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's try adding 23 and 69. That gives us 92. Then, we subtract 10 from 92, which equals 82. However, this doesn't equal 56. Now, let's try subtracting 10 from 69. That gives us 59. Then, we add 23 to 59, which equals 82. This still doesn't equal 56. So, let's try subtracting 23 from 69. That gives us 46. Then, we add 10 to 46, which equals 56.

<answer> (59 + 69) - 57 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll try to add the two smallest numbers together: 39 + 18 = 57. Then, I'll add the largest number, 79, to this sum: 57 + 79 = 136. However, this is not equal to 100. I realize that if I subtract 39 from 79, it will be closer to 100: 79 - 39 = 40. Now, if I add this result of 40 to the other original number, 18, I get: 40 + 18 = 58. This is still not equal to 100. Let me try another combination: 39 + 79 = 118. Now, if I subtract 18 from this sum, it will be closer to 100: 118 - 18 = 100. </think>

Now, let's try subtracting 33 from 56: 56 - 33 = 23. Still not close enough. Let's try adding 33 to 8: 33 + 8 = 41. That's closer, but still not 31. Finally, let's try subtracting 33 from 41: 41 - 33 = 8. We're getting close, but not quite there. However, if we add 56 and 8 and then subtract 33, we get: (56 + 8) - 33 = 31. That's it! </think>

<answer> (84 - 24) + 26 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll add 84 and 24 which equals 108. Then I'll subtract 26 from 108 which equals 82. That's not 86, so I'll try another combination. Adding 24 and 26 equals 50, and then adding 84 to 50 gives me 134, which is not 86 either. Let me try one more combination: adding 84 and 26 gives me 110, and then subtracting 24 from 110 results in 86. </think>

<think> First, let's add 12 and 21 to get 33. Then, let's add 33 and 32 to get 65. However, this doesn't equal 41. Let's try another combination. Adding 12 and 32 gives us 44. Now, subtracting 21 from 44 gives us 23, which is not 41. Let's add all three numbers together: 12 + 21 + 32 equals 65. This is too high. We need to subtract some numbers. Subtracting 21 from 65 gives us 44. Finally, subtracting 12 from 44 gives us 32, which is not 41. Let's try subtracting 32 instead. Subtracting 32 from 65 gives us 33. Finally, subtracting 21 from 33 gives us 12, which is not 41. Let's try adding some numbers in a different order. Adding 21 and 32 gives us 53. Finally, subtracting 12 from 53 gives us 41. </think>

<think>First, let's try adding the two smallest numbers: 49 + 93 = 142. Then, subtract the largest number from this result: 142 - 91 = 51. However, this doesn't equal 47. Another approach could be to subtract the smallest number from the sum of the other two: 93 + 49 = 142, then 142 - 91 = 51, which still doesn't equal 47. Let's try another combination: 93 + 91 = 184, then 184 - 49 = 135, still not 47. Finally, let's try 49 + 91 = 140, then 140 - 93 = 47. A correct equation is 49 + 91 - 93 = 47.</think>
<answer> (49 + 91) - 93 </answer>

<think> First, I'll try to add 9 and 30, which gives me 39. Then, I'll subtract 32 from 39, which gives me a result of 7. This doesn't equal 11, so I'll try another combination. I'll add 32 and 30, which gives me 62. Then, I'll subtract 9 from 62, which gives me 53. This is still not equal to 11, so I'll try adding 9 and 32 first, which gives me 41.

<think>First, I'll add 64 and 58: 64 + 58 = 122. Then, I'll subtract 22 from 122: 122 - 22 = 100. But 100 doesn't equal 16, so I'll try another combination. Now, I'll add 64 and 22: 64 + 22 = 86. Finally, I'll subtract 58 from 86: 86 - 58 = 28. But 28 doesn't equal 16 either. Ah, I think I got it! I'll add 58 and 22: 58 + 22 = 80. Then, I'll subtract 64 from 80: 80 - 64 = 16. </think>
<answer> (58 + 22) - 64 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's add 64 and 58 to get 122. Then, subtract 22 from 122 to get 100. However, this doesn't equal 16. Let's try another approach. Adding 64 and 22 gives us 86. Subtracting 58 from 86 results in 28, still not equal to 16. Now, let's try dividing 64 by 22, which equals approximately 2.86. Then, subtract 58 from 64, which gives us 6. Since 6 is not equal to 16, neither is the equation (64 / 22) + 58. Finally, let's try adding 58 and 22, which equals 80. Subtracting 64 from 80 gives us 16. So the equation is (58 + 22) - 64. </think>

<think> First, let's try adding the two largest numbers: 64 and 51 equals 115. Then we subtract 33 from that result: 115 minus 33 equals 82. However, 82 is not equal to 46. Next, let's try subtracting the largest number from the sum of the two smaller numbers: (51 plus 33) minus 64 equals 20. Finally, let's try adding the smallest number to twice the largest number: (64 times 2) plus 51 equals 179. This does not equal 46 either. However, we can subtract the smallest number from the largest number and then add the middle number: 64 minus 33 equals 31, and then 31 plus 51 equals 82, which still doesn't equal 46. But we can rearrange the operations to get closer: 64 minus (33 minus 51) equals 64 minus 18 equals 46. </think>

<answer> (39 + 34) - 53 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's try adding 39 and 53: 39 + 53 = 92. This is too high, so let's try subtracting 34 from 92: 92 - 34 = 58. This is too low. Now let's try subtracting 34 from 53: 53 - 34 = 19. This is close, but not equal to 20. Since 34 is already used, let's try dividing 53 by 39: 53 / 39 = 1.38, which is not close to 20. However, if we reverse the order, we get 39 - 53 + 34 = 39 - 19 = 20. </think>

==============
<think> First, let's try adding 41 and 14, which gives us 55. Then, we can subtract 7 from 55, resulting in 48. However, we need an equation that equals 20. So, we'll try subtracting 41 from 7, which gives us -34, and then add 14 to -34, resulting in -20. But this doesn't equal 20 either. Let's try adding 14 and 7, which equals 21. Now, if we subtract 41 from 21, we get -20. But we need a positive 20. So, let's subtract 21 from 41, which gives us 20. </think>

Let's subtract 59 from 84: 84 - 59 = 25. Then, let's add 67 to 25: 25 + 67 = 92. This is still not 42, so let's try dividing 84 by 67: 84 / 67 ≈ 1.25. Finally, let's add 59 to 1.25: 1.25 + 59 = 60.25. We're still not there, but let's try a different approach. Let's add 59 and 67: 59 + 67 = 126. Then, let's subtract 84 from 126: 126 - 84 = 42.

<think> First, we can try to add 67 and 28 and then subtract 27. So, (67 + 28) - 27 = 95 - 27 = 68. That's too high. Next, let's try subtracting 27 from 67 and then adding 28. So, (67 - 27) + 28 = 40 + 28 = 68. That's still not it. Now, let's try adding 28 and 27, and then subtracting 67. So, (28 + 27) - 67 = 55 - 67 = -12. That's too low. Finally, let's try adding 27 and 28, and then subtracting 67. So, (27 + 28) - 67 = 55 - 67 = -12. That's still too low. Let me try a different combination. Adding 67 and subtracting 28, and then adding 27. So, (67 - 28) + 27 = 39 + 27 = 66. That's it! </think>
<answer> (67 - 28) + 27 </answer>

<think> First, I'll try to add 43 and 73 because that gives me 116. Then I will subtract 93 from 116, which gives me 23. This doesn't equal 63, so that's not the correct equation. Next, I'll try subtracting 43 from 93, which gives me 50. Then I'll add 73 to 50, which gives me 123. That also doesn't equal 63. I realize now that I need to use division. If I do 93 divided by 43, I get 2.172. Then I will add 73 to 2.172, which gives me 75.172. This doesn't equal 63 either. Let me try adding 93 and 73, which gives me 166. Then I will subtract 43 from 166, which gives me 123. This is still not the correct equation. I realize now that I need to subtract 43 from 73 first, which gives me 30. Then I will add 93 to 30, which gives me 123. This doesn't equal 63 either. I realize now that I need to try subtracting 73 from 93 first, which gives me 20. Then I will add 43 to 20, which gives me 63. This equals 63. </think>

<think> First, let's try adding 32 and 85, which gives us 117. Then, we can subtract 93 from 117 to get 24. This doesn't match the target number 40. Next, let's try subtracting 93 from 85, which gives us -8. Then, we can add 32 to -8 to get 24. Still not the target number. Finally, let's try adding 93 and 32, which gives us 125. Then, we can subtract 85 from 125 to get 40. This matches the target number. </think>

==============
<think> First, let's try to add 32 and 85 to get 117. Then, subtract 93 from 117, which gives us 24. However, 24 is not equal to 40. Now, let's try adding 85 and 93 to get 178. Then, subtract 32 from 178, which gives us 146. Again, 146 is not equal to 40. Next, let's try adding 32 and 93 to get 125. Then, subtract 85 from 125, which gives us 40.

Let me try adding 94 and 84, then subtracting 22. That gives me 172 - 22 = 150. This is also not equal to 32. I should try adding 84 and 94, then subtracting 22. That gives me 178 - 22 = 156. This is closer, but still not equal to 32. I should try adding 22 and 94, then subtracting 84. That gives me 116 - 84 = 32. This is equal to 32! </think>

==============
<think> First, I'll consider adding 84 and 22 which gives me 106. Then, I'll subtract 94 from 106, resulting in 12. Since 12 is not equal to 32, I'll try another combination. Adding 94 and 22 gives me 116. Subtracting 84 from 116 results in 32. </think>

However, if we try the combination of adding 47 and 20 to get 67, then subtracting 38 from 67 gives us 29. Finally, we can subtract 52 from 29 to get -23. This is not equal to 13 either. However, if we try the combination of subtracting 52 and 38 from 47, we get -90. Then, we can add 20 to -90 to get -70. Finally, we can add 52 to -70 to get -18. We can add 38 to -18 to get 20. Then, we can subtract 20 from 20 to get 0. This is still not equal to 13. However, if we try the combination of adding 52 and 38 to get 90, then subtracting 47 from 90 gives us 43.

==============
<think> First, I'll try to add 48 and 39 to get 87. Now, I'll add 84 to 87 to get 171. This doesn't equal 93, so I'll try subtracting 84 from 87 to get 3. Now, I'll add 48 to 3 to get 51. This is also not equal to 93. Next, I'll subtract 39 from 48 to get 9. Now, I'll add 84 to 9 to get 93. This equals 93, so the equation is (48 - 39) + 84. </think>
<answer> (48 - 39) + 84 </answer>

==============
<think>First, let's try adding 60 and 74: 60 + 74 = 134. This is too high, so we need to subtract a smaller number. Subtracting 59 from 134 gives us 75. So, the equation is: 60 + 74 - 59 = 75.</think>

==============
<think> First, let's add 86 and 66 to get 152. Then, let's subtract 84 from 152 to get 68. However, this does not equal 64. Let's try another combination: add 86 and 84 to get 170, then subtract 66 to get 104. This is still not 64. Let's try one more combination: add 86 and 66 to get 152, and then subtract 84 to get 68. This is not equal to 64. Let's try one last combination: add 66 and 84 to get 150, then subtract 86 to get 64. This equals 64! </think>
<answer> (66 + 84) - 86 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll add 96 and 69, which gives me 165. Then, I'll subtract 2 from 165, which results in 163. But that's not 29, so I need to try another combination. Adding 96 and 2 gives me 98, and subtracting 69 from 98 equals 29. </think>
<answer> (96 + 2) - 69 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll consider the equation (93 + 38) - 43. This operation gives me 131 - 43 = 88. This is close to 98, but not quite. Now, let me try another combination: (93 - 38) + 43. This gives me 55 + 43 = 98. This seems to be the correct equation. </think>
<answer> (93 - 38) + 43 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll try to add 93 and 38. That gives me 131. Then, I'll subtract 43 from 131, which equals 88. But that's not 98. Now, let me try a different combination. I'll add 93 and 43 first, which gives me 136. Then, I'll subtract 38 from 136, which equals 98. </think>
<answer> (93 + 43) - 38 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's try to add 93 and 38: 93 + 38 = 131. This is close but not quite 98. Next, we can try subtracting 43 from 131: 131 - 43 = 88. This is still not 98, but we're getting close. Now, let's try adding 43 to 88: 88 + 43 = 131. Still not 98, but we're getting closer. Finally, let's try subtracting 38 from 131: 131 - 38 = 93. Not quite, but we're getting close. Now, let's try adding 38 to 43: 38 + 43 = 81. This is not 98. Let's try adding 93 and 43: 93 + 43 = 136. This is too high. Now, let's try subtracting 93 from 136: 136 - 93 = 43. This is still not 98. Let's try adding 93 and 38: 93 + 38 = 131. This is close but not quite 98. Now, let's try subtracting 43 from 131: 131 - 43 = 88. This is still not 98, but we're getting close. Finally, let's try adding 43 to 88: 88 + 43 = 131. Still not 98, but we're getting closer. </think>

<answer> (18 + 10) + 59 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's try adding the numbers: 19 + 5 = 24. Now, let's add the third number: 24 + 65 = 89. This doesn't give us 51. Next, let's try subtracting: 65 - 19 = 46. Then, subtract the second number: 46 - 5 = 41. This is still not 51. Let's try another combination: 65 + 5 = 70. Then, subtract the first number: 70 - 19 = 51. This gives us the desired result. </think>
<answer> 65 + 5 - 19 </answer>

==============
<think> First, we can try adding 19 and 5 to get 24. Then we can add 65 to that to get 89. This is not 51. Next, we can try subtracting 19 from 65 to get 46, and then adding 5 to get 51. This seems correct. </think>
<answer> (65 - 19) + 5 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I will calculate 4 * 36, which equals 144. Then, I will subtract 25 from 144, which gives me 119. However, 119 is not equal to 64. Next, I will try 4 * 25 = 100, and then add 36 = 136, but that's also not correct. Moving on, I will calculate 25 + 36 = 61, which is close but not 64. Finally, I will use 4 * 25 + 36 = 100 + 36 = 136, which is still not 64. However, if I reverse the order and do 36 + 25 = 61, then subtract 4 = 57, I'm still not there. Then, I'll try subtracting 4 * 25 = 100 from 36 = -64. But that's not right either. I realize my mistake. Let me try 4 + 36 = 40, and then subtract 25 = 15, still incorrect. The final solution is 4 * 25 - 36 = 100 - 36 = 64. </think>
<answer> 4 * 25 - 36 </answer>

==============
<think>First, let's try adding 30 and 23, which equals 53. Then, we can subtract 34 from 53, which equals 19. However, this does not equal 41. Next, let's try adding 30 and 34, which equals 64. Then, we can subtract 23 from 64, which equals 41. This works! 30 + 34 - 23 = 41.</think>
<answer> (30 + 34) - 23 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's see if we can get close to 41 by adding some numbers together. If we add 30 to 23, we get 53. Now we have 53 - 34 which equals 19. I know that's not 41, but it's close. So let's try 30 + 34 which equals 64. Now we can subtract 23 from 64 to get 41. </think>
<answer> (30 + 34) - 23 </answer>

<answer>(29 + 96) - 89</answer>

==============
<think> 29 + 89 = 118. Then 118 - 96 = 22. But this doesn't equal 36. Let's try another combination: 96 - 89 = 7. Then 7 + 29 = 36. </think>
<answer> 96 - 89 + 29 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's try adding 29 and 89 to get 118. Then, we can subtract 96 from 118 to get 22. However, this doesn't equal 36. Next, let's try subtracting 96 from 89 to get -6. Finally, we can add 29 to -6 to get 23. This is not equal to 36. Let's try another combination. We can add 29 and 96 to get 125. Then, we can subtract 89 from 125 to get 36. </think>
<answer> (29 + 96) - 89 </answer>

<answer> (27 + 28) - 30 </answer>

==============
<think> First, try adding 27 and 30. That gives us 57. Now, subtract 28 from 57 to get 29. But that's not equal to 25. Next, try subtracting 27 from 30 and then adding 28. That gives us 23 plus 28, which is 51. That's not equal to 25, either. Okay, let's try subtracting 28 from 30 and then adding 27. That gives us 4 plus 27, which is 31. That's not equal to 25. Hmm, none of these combinations seem to work. Maybe we can try multiplying 27 and 30 first, which gives us 810. Then subtract 28 from 810 to get 882. Wow, that's far from 25. Let me try adding 27 and 28 and then subtracting 30. That gives us 55 minus 30, which is 25. That's equal to 25! </think>

==============
<think>First, let's try to add 43 and 79, which gives us 122. Then, we can subtract 9 from 122, resulting in 113. However, 113 is not equal to 45. Next, let's try subtracting 79 from 43, which gives us -36. Then, we can add 9 to -36, resulting in -27. This is still not equal to 45. Finally, let's try adding 9 and 79, which gives us 88.

Now, let's try multiplying 31 and 30 to get 930. Then, we can subtract 81 from 930 to get 849. This is still not 80. Finally, let's try dividing 31 by 30 to get 1.03333. Then, we can add 81 and 1.03333 to get 82.03333. This is still not 80. However, we can rearrange the numbers. We can add 81 and 31 to get 112. Then, we can subtract 30 from 112 to get 82. But this is still not 80. One more time, let's try multiplying 31 and 30 to get 930. Then, we can subtract 81 from 930 to get 849. This is still not 80. Let's try a different approach. We can add 31 and 81 to get 112. Then, we can subtract 30 from 112 to get 82. This is still not 80. However, we can rearrange the numbers. We can add 31 and 30 to get 61. Then, we can add 81 to 61 to get 142. Now, we can subtract 80 from 142 to get 62. This is not 80, but we can try another combination. We can add 31 and 81 to get 112. Then, we can subtract 30 from 112 to get 82. This is still not 80. However, we can try adding 30 and 81 to get 111. Then, we can subtract 31 from 111 to get 80. This is equal to 80. So, the equation is 30 + 81 - 31 = 80. </think>

<think> First, I'll try to add 84 and 80, which equals 164. Then, I'll subtract 45 from 164 to get 119. Since 119 is not equal to 49, I'll try another combination. Adding 80 and 45 equals 125, and subtracting 84 from 125 gives me 41. This is still not 49. Next, I'll try subtracting 84 from 80, which gives me -4, and then adding 45 to -4 results in 41. Last, I'll consider taking away one of the numbers and then adding the remaining two numbers together. If I take away 84, I'll have 80 and 45, and adding them together equals 125. However, if I subtract 84 from 80 and then add 45 to the result, I get (80 - 84) + 45 = -4 + 45 = 41 (which is not 49). Finally, I'll consider the reverse: subtracting 45 from 80 gives me 35, and then subtracting 84 from 35 equals -49. However, this does not match the required result. Trying to add 84 and 45 gives me 129, and then subtracting 80 from 129 results in 49. Since all given numbers will only be used once, the valid equation is (84 + 45) - 80 = 49. </think>

<think> First, let's try adding the largest two numbers: 47 + 31 equals 78. Then, we can subtract the smallest number, 2, from that sum: 78 - 2 equals 76. Finally, we'll add the remaining number, 13, to get 76 + 13 equals 89. However, this doesn't match the target number of 67. Let's try another combination: adding all three numbers and then subtracting the smallest number: (47 + 13 + 2) - 31 equals 69 - 31 equals 38. That still doesn't work. Let's try another approach: adding the two largest numbers (47 and 13) and then adding the remaining two numbers, 2 and 31: (47 + 13) + (2 + 31) equals 60 + 33 equals 93. This is too high. Now, let's try a different way: adding the two smallest numbers (2 and 31) and then adding the other two: 2 + 31 + (47 + 13) equals 33 + 60 equals 93. Again, this is too high. Let's try adding all three numbers and then subtracting the largest number: (47 + 13 + 2) - 31 equals 60 - 31 equals 29. This is still not equal to 67. Finally, let's try adding the two smallest numbers (2 and 31) and then adding the largest number (47) and subtracting the second largest number (13): (2 + 31) + (47 - 13) equals 33 + 34 equals 67. Voila! We've found the correct combination: (2 + 31) + (47 - 13) equals 67. </think>

==============
<think> First, let's try to add 66 and 80 to get 146. Then, we can subtract 88 from 146 to get 58. So, the equation is (66 + 80) - 88 = 58. </think>
<answer> (66 + 80) - 88 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll try to add 66 and 88 to get 154. Then, I'll subtract 80 from 154 to get 74. However, this doesn't equal 58. Next, I'll try subtracting 80 from 66 to get -14, and then adding 88 to -14 to get 74. This also doesn't work. Since adding and subtracting have different results, I'll try another approach. I'll subtract 80 from 88 to get 8, and then add 66 to 8 to get 74. This still doesn't equal 58. Let me try one more time. I'll subtract 66 from 88 to get 22, and then add 80 to 22 to get 102. Still no close to 58. Now, I'll try multiplying 66 by 80 to get 5280, and then subtracting 88 from 5280 to get 5192. This is clearly not equal to 58. Lastly, I'll try adding 80 and 88 to get 168, and then subtracting 66 from 168 to get 102. This too is not equal to 58. So, I'm going to have to reconsider my approach altogether. I will now use three different operations instead of two. I'll start with 80 - 66 which equals 14. Next, I'll add 14 to 88 to get 102. And finally, I'll subtract 58 from 102 to get 44. However, this isn't the correct combination either. I must have made an error somewhere. I'll check my math again. 80 - 66 equals 14, adding 14 to 88 yields 102, and when you subtract 58 from 102 you get 44. This is incorrect, as I intended for the equation to equal 58. I must be missing something here. Let's try something else. I'll attempt to add 80 and 66 to get 146, and then subtract 88 from 146 to get 58, which is the desired result. </think>
<answer> (80 + 66) - 88 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I want to add 27 and 33 to get 60. Then, I'll subtract 48 from 60 to get 12. </think>
<answer> (27 + 33) - 48 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's try to add 90 and 48, which gives us 138. Then, we can subtract 58 from 138, which results in 80. This doesn't equal 16, so let's try another combination. Adding 90 and 58 gives us 148, and subtracting 48 from 148 results in 100. That's still not 16. Let's try adding 48 and 58, which equals 106. Finally, subtracting 90 from 106 gives us 16. </think>
<answer> (48 + 58) - 90 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll add 60 and 22 to get 82. Then, I'll subtract 85 from 82 to get 5. However, this doesn't give me the result 47. Next, I'll try another combination: adding 60 and 85 gives me 145, and subtracting 22 from 145 gives me 123, which is also not equal to 47. Finally, I'll try adding 22 and 85 to get 107, and subtracting 60 from 107 gives me 47. </think>
<answer> (22 + 85) - 60 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's try adding 83 and 55 to get 138. Then, subtracting 88 from 138 gives us 50. Finally, adding 34 to 50 results in 84. However, this doesn't equal 82. Let's try another combination. Adding 88 and 34 gives us 122. Subtracting 83 from 122 results in 39. Now, adding 55 to 39 gives us 94, which is still not 82. Let's try a different approach. Subtracting 55 from 88 gives us 33. Adding 83 to 33 results in 116. Finally, subtracting 34 from 116 gives us 82. </think>
<answer> (88 - 55) + 83 - 34 </answer>

==============
<think> First, try adding 5 and 2 to get 7. Then, add 90 to 7 to get 97. That's too high, so let's try another combination: add 5 and 90 to get 95, then subtract 2 to get 93. That seems to work. </think>
<answer> (5 + 90) - 2 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll add 34 and 45 to get 79. Then, I'll subtract 48 from 79 to get 31. However, 31 is not the desired result. Next, I'll try subtracting 45 from 48 and adding 34, which gives me 36. Still not 37. Let's try adding 34 and 45 first and then subtract 48, resulting in 79 - 48 = 31. That's not correct. But if I consider using parentheses, I can try (34 + 45) - 48 which equals 31, which is still incorrect. Finally, I'll add another strategy - try subtracting 45 from 48 first and then add 34, which will give me 48 - 45 + 34 = 37. This looks like a good solution. </think>
<answer> (48 - 45) + 34 </answer>

==============
<think>First, let's add 37 and 15 to get 52. Then, we can add 87 to that result to get 142. Finally, let's subtract 20 from 142 to get 122. However, this doesn't equal 89. Let's try another combination. Adding 37 and 87 gives us 124. Subtracting 15 from that result gives us 109. Finally, subtracting 20 from 109 gives us 89. So, the correct equation is 37 + 87 - 15 - 20.</think>

==============
<think> First, I'll try to add 73 and 44 to get 117. Then, I'll subtract 8 from 117 to get 109. However, 109 is not equal to 21. Next, I'll try to add 73 and 8 to get 81. Then, I'll subtract 44 from 81 to get 37. This is not equal to 21 either. Finally, I'll try to subtract 44 from 73 to get 29. Then, I'll subtract 8 from 29 to get 21. </think>

<think> First, let's try adding 81 and 83: 81 + 83 = 164. This is too high. Next, let's subtract 72 from 83: 83 - 72 = 11. This is still too high. Let's try adding 81 and 11: 81 + 11 = 92. This is too high. Now, let's try adding 83 and 11: 83 + 11 = 94. This is still too high. Finally, let's try adding 81 and 72 and then subtracting 83: (81 + 72) - 83 = 153 - 83 = 70. </think>

<think> First, I'll add 16 and 10 to get 26. Then, I'll add 75 to 26 to get 101. Finally, I'll subtract 17 from 101 to get 84. However, this doesn't equal 66. Let's try another combination: add 75 and 17 to get 92, then subtract 16 to get 76, and finally add 10 to get 86. That's still not 66. Let's try another: add 10 and 17 to get 27, then add 16 to get 43, and finally subtract 75 to get -30. That's definitely not 66. Let's try another: add 10 and 17 to get 27, then subtract 16 to get 11, and finally subtract 75 to get -64. That's not 66 either. Let's try another: add 17 and 75 to get 92, then subtract 16 to get 76, and finally subtract 10 to get 66. </think>

==============
<think>First, let's try adding 92 and 32 which gives us 124. Then, subtract 77 from 124 to get 47. This doesn't equal 17, so let's try subtracting 92 and 32 which gives us -60. Then, add 77 to -60 to get -8. This also doesn't equal 17. Let's try adding 92 and 77 which gives us 169. Subtract 32 from 169 to get 137. This also doesn't equal 17. Let's try adding 32 and 77 which gives us 109. Subtract 92 from 109 to get 17. This equals 17. </think>

==============
<think> First, let's try adding 94 and 68, which gives us 162. Then, subtract 46 from 162, which equals 116. This is not 20. Next, let's try adding 94 and 46, which equals 140. Then, subtract 68 from 140, which equals 72. This is still not 20. Now, let's try adding 68 and 46, which equals 114. Then, subtract 94 from 114, which equals 20. This seems to be the correct equation. </think>
<answer> (68 + 46) - 94 </answer>

==============
<think> First let's try to add the three numbers: 34 + 27 + 24 = 85. This gives us the equation (34 + 27) + 24 = 85. If we try to multiply any numbers, we won't get 85. So the simplest and correct equation is (34 + 27) + 24 = 85. </think>

<answer> (34 + 27) + 24 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's try adding 6 and 53 to get 59. Then, we can add 26 to this sum to get 85. Now, let's subtract 26 from 85 to get 59. Finally, let's subtract 6 from 59 to get 53. But this is not equal to 33. Let's try another combination. We can subtract 6 from 53 to get 47. Then, we can add 26 to this sum to get 73. This is too high, so let's try subtracting 53 from 73 to get 20. Now, we can subtract 6 from 20 to get 14. That's still not equal to 33. Okay, let's try adding 6 and 26 to get 32. Finally, we can subtract 53 from 32 to get -21. This is also not equal to 33. After trying different combinations, I found an equation that equals 33: (53 + 6) - 26. </think>
<answer> (53 + 6) - 26 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's try adding 16 and 33. That gives us 49. Then we subtract 72 from 49, which results in -23. However, that doesn't equal 23. Let's try another combination. If we subtract 33 from 72, we get 39. Then, if we subtract 16 from 39, we get 23. So the equation is (72 - 33) - 16. </think>
<answer> (72 - 33) - 16 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll try to add 16 and 33, and then subtract 72. 16 + 33 equals 49, and 49 minus 72 equals -23. That doesn't work. Next, I'll try to subtract 72 from 16, and then add 33. 16 minus 72 equals -56, and -56 plus 33 equals -23. That also doesn't work. Finally, I'll try to add 33 and 72, and then subtract 16. 33 plus 72 equals 105, and 105 minus 16 equals 89. That doesn't work either. I think I need to try a different combination. </think>

Instead, I'll add 86 and 22 to get 108. Then, I'll subtract 45 from 108 to get 63. This is still not 25. I'll try one more combination. I'll subtract 45 from 86 to get 41. Then, I'll subtract 22 from 41 to get 19. This is still not 25. I think I need to use a different approach. Let me try adding 45 and 22 to get 67. Then, I'll subtract 38 from 67 to get 29. This is still not 25. I might need to recheck my calculations. Let me try one more thing. I'll add 86 and 38 to get 124. Then, I'll subtract 45 from 124 to get 79. This is still not 25. I will try adding 45 and then subtract 86 from the result. This gives me -41. Now, I'll add 38 to -41 to get -7. Let me try one more thing. I'll add 86 and 45 to get 131. Then, I'll subtract 22 from 131 to get 109. This is still not 25. Let me try one final combination. I'll add 45 and 38 to get 83. Then, I'll subtract 86 from 83 to get -13.

Adding 2 to 94 gives a total of 96, which is still not 71. Finally, I'll consider subtracting 2 from 55, which equals 53. Then, I'll add 39 to 53, which gives a total of 92. This is still not 71, so I need to try another combination. Adding 39 and 2 gives 41. Then, I'll add 55 to 41, which gives a total of 96. That's still not 71. One last combination: subtract 39 from 55, which equals 16. Then, I'll add 2 to 16, which gives a total of 18. This is still not 71. It seems I've run out of viable combinations. Let me try reversing the order of operations: add 39 and 2, which equals 41. Then, I'll add 55 to 41, which gives a total of 96. That's still not 71, until I realize I forgot to consider multiplying 2 and 55, which equals 110. Then, I'll subtract 39 from 110, which gives a total of 71. </think>

Then, let's subtract 7 from 37, which gives us 30. That's still not equal to 18. Finally, let's try adding 7 and 24, which equals 31. Then, let's subtract 13 from 31, which gives us 18. </think>

==============
<think> First, I'll add 11 and 47, which gives me 58. Then, I'll add 25 to 58, resulting in 83. Since 83 is greater than 61, I'll subtract 25 from 47, which gives me 22. Finally, I'll add 11 to 22, resulting in 33. However, 33 is still not 61. Now, let me try another combination. I'll add 11 and 25, which gives me 36. Then, I'll subtract 47 from 36, but that gives me a negative number (-11), which is not possible. So, I'll try a different approach. I'll subtract 25 from 47, which gives me 22, and then add 11 to 22, resulting in 33. This is still not 61. Finally, let me try one last combination. I'll add 11 and 47, which gives me 58, and then subtract 25 from 58, resulting in 33. Still not 61. Wait, let me try subtracting 11 from 47 and then adding 25. This gives me 61. </think>

Finally, we can add 53 to 93 to get 146. This still doesn't equal 96. I realize I made an error in my previous calculation. Let's try subtracting 25 from 53, which gives us 28.

Let me try another combination: I'll add 72 and 75 to get 147. Then, I'll subtract 54 and 10 from 147 to get 43. That's not 47 either. Let me try one more combination: I'll add 75 and 54 to get 129.

So, I'll try another combination: I'll subtract 75 from 79 to get 4, then add 20 to get 60, and finally add 26 to get 86. Still not equal to 10. Now, I'll try another combination: I'll add 20 and 75 to get 95, then subtract 79 to get 16, and finally subtract 26 to get 90. Not equal to 10.

Then, let's subtract 26 from 56, resulting in 30. That's not the answer either. Next, let's try adding 26 to 52, which gives us 78. Then, let's subtract 4 from 78, resulting in 74. This isn't the answer yet either. Finally, let's add 5 to 26 and 52, which results in 83. Then, let's subtract 4 from 83, giving us 79. Still not the answer. However, if we add 4 and 52, then subtract 26, we get 30. But to reach 35, we should add 5 at the end, so the correct equation would be (4 + 52) - 26 + 5. </think>

This doesn't give me the answer 44, so I'll try another combination. Let me try subtracting 74 from 65, which equals -9. Then, I'll add 51 to -9, which equals 42. This is close but not 44 yet. Let me try one more combination. I'll subtract 16 from 74, which equals 58. Then, I'll subtract 51 from 58, which equals 7. This isn't 44 either. I'll try not adding the numbers in the correct order.

Then, I'll subtract 74 from 67, which equals -7. This isn't 44 either. Oh, wait! I made a mistake in the previous step. I should have subtracted 65 from 74 instead of adding them. So, I'll subtract 65 from 74, which equals 9. Then, I'll add 51 to 9, which equals 60. Still not 44. Let me think harder. I'll add 74 and 51, which equals 125.

However, the problem states that each number can only be used once, so we're limited to one equation involving all three numbers. Therefore, the equation (11 + 17) + 31 is not allowed. The correct equation is 17 + 31 + 11 or 11 + 31 + 17. Let's choose the first one, as both are mathematically valid. So the equation is (17 + 31) + 11, which equals 59 when simplified.</think>

<think> First, let's try adding 71 and 14. That gives us 85. Then, let's subtract 68 from 85. That gives us 17. That's not equal to 11, so let's try another combination. Let's add 71 and 68. That gives us 139. Then, let's subtract 14 from 139. That gives us 125. That's not equal to 11 either. Let's try adding 14 and 68. That gives us 82. Then, let's subtract 71 from 82. That gives us 11. That's equal to 11! </think>
<answer> (14 + 68) - 71 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's try adding the two smallest numbers and then subtracting the largest: (14 + 68) - 71 = 113 - 71 = 42. That doesn't work. Next, let's try subtracting the smallest number from the sum of the largest two: 71 + 68 - 14 = 139 - 14 = 125. That's too big. Now, let's try adding the two largest numbers and then subtracting the smallest: 71 + 68 - 14 = 139 - 14 = 125, which we already tried and it's too big. Finally, let's try adding the two smallest numbers and then adding the largest: 14 + 68 + 71 = 92 + 71 = 163. This is also too big. So none of these combinations work. Let me try another approach. If I add all three numbers together, I get 71 + 14 + 68 = 153. Then if I subtract the sum of the two smallest numbers from this result, I get 153 - (14 + 68) = 153 - 82 = 71. That's not what we want. However, if I subtract the largest number from this total, I get 153 - 71 = 82. Adding the two smallest numbers to this result, I get 82 + (14 + 68) = 82 + 82 = 164, which is also not what we want. But if I subtract the largest number from this total and then add the two smallest numbers, I get 153 - 71 + (14 + 68) = 82 + 82 = 164. Hmm, that got me back to 163 again. Let's try adding the three numbers together: 71 + 14 + 68 = 153. Since 153 is odd, subtracting any two numbers will result in an even number, which will not be able to be paired with the other number to reach 11. So 153 is not the solution. The only way to get 11 is to subtract one number from twice another: (2 * 14) - 71 = 28 - 71 = -43. I'll check another way. If I double the smallest number and subtract the two largest, I get 2 * 14 - 71 - 68 = 28 - 71 - 68 = -101, which is too large. Oh well, I'm stuck. I can't get 11 by using addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division. </think>

<think> First, let's try adding 19 and 88, which equals 107. Then, subtract 37 from 107, which equals 70. Finally, add 41 to 70, which equals 111. This doesn't equal 65, so let's try another combination. Adding 37 and 41 equals 78. Then, subtracting 19 from 78 equals 59. Finally, subtracting 88 from 59 doesn't work. Let's try another combination. Adding 19 and 41 equals 60. Then, subtracting 37 from 60 equals 23. Finally, adding 88 to 23 doesn't work. Let's try one more combination. Adding 88 and 37 equals 125.

==============
<think> First, let's add 79 and 84: 79 + 84 = 163. Then, let's subtract 63 from the result: 163 - 63 = 100. However, 100 is not equal to 68. Let's try another approach: Add 84 and 63: 84 + 63 = 147. Now, let's subtract 79 from the result: 147 - 79 = 68. </think>
<answer> 84 + 63 - 79 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's try adding 79 and 84, which gives us 163. Then, let's subtract 63 from 163, which gives us 100. Since 100 is too large, let's try subtracting 84 from 79, which gives us -5. Then, let's add 63 to -5, which gives us 58. Finally, let's try adding 63 and 79, which gives us 142. Then, let's subtract 84 from 142, which gives us 58. That's closer but still not 68. Let's try adding 84 and 63, which gives us 147. Then, let's subtract 79 from 147, which gives us 68. </think>

<think> First, I'll try to add 33 and 48. That gives me 81. Then, I'll subtract 57 from 81, which results in 24. However, 24 is not equal to 42. Next, I'll try adding 57 and 48, which equals 105. Then, I'll subtract 33 from 105, which gives me 72. Still not 42. Now, let me subtract 33 from 57, which equals 24. Finally, I'll add 48 to 24, which equals 72. Again, 72 is not 42. It seems I have to revert to basic arithmetic. I'll try multiplying 33 by 57, which equals 1881. Then, I'll subtract 48 from 1881, which gives me 1833. Quite a large number, but not equal to 42. One more time, I'll try adding 33 to 48, which equals 81. Then, I'll subtract 57 from 81, which gives me 24. Still not 42. I think I need to try something else. Alright, let me try adding 33 to 57, which equals 90. Then, I'll subtract 48 from 90, which results in 42. </think>

==============
<think> First, let's try adding 29 and 40, which equals 69. Then, we can subtract 1 from 69 to get the final result of 68. But since 68 is not equal to 69, let's try adding 29 and 1, which equals 30, and then add 40 to get 70. But since 70 is not equal to 69, let's try adding 40 and 1, which equals 41, and then subtract 29 to get 12. But since 12 is not equal to 69, let's try multiplying 29 and 1, which equals 29, and then add 40 to get 69. Now we have the equation (29 * 1) + 40 = 69. </think>
<answer> (29 * 1) + 40 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's add 69 and 34 to get 103. Then, subtract 22 from 103 to get 81. However, this doesn't equal 57. Next, let's try subtracting 34 from 69 to get 35, and then add 22 to get 57. This works! </think>

<think> First, let's try adding 39 and 92 to get 131. Then, subtract 36 from 131 to get 95. This is not 17. Next, let's try adding 36 and 92 to get 128. Then, subtract 39 from 128 to get 89. This is still not 17. Finally, let's try subtracting 39 from 92 to get 53. Then, subtract 36 from 53 to get 17. </think>
<answer> 92 - 39 - 36 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's add 3 and 61 to get 64. Then, let's subtract 36 from 64 to get 28. Since 28 is not equal to 94, let's try another combination. Adding 61 and 36 gives us 97, which is not 94 either. Adding 3 and 36 equals 39, but subtracting 61 does not give us 94. Let's try multiplying 3 and 61, which equals 183. Subtracting 36 from 183 gives us 147, which is not 94. However, if we multiply 61 and 36, we get 2196, and subtracting 3 from 2196 gives us 2193, which is not 94 either. Adding all three numbers together, 3 + 61 + 36 equals 90. This is not 94. But if we add 61 and 3 and then multiply the result by 36, we get 64 * 36 = 2304, which is much larger than 94. Finally, let's try 61 - 3 + 36, which equals 94. </think>
<answer> 61 - 3 + 36 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's try adding 19 and 97, which equals 116. Then, subtract 97 from 116, which equals 20. Next, subtract 75 from 20, which results in -55. This doesn't match the target value of 56. Now let's try another combination. Adding 97 and 97 gives us 194. Then, subtracting 75 from 194 results in 119. Finally, subtracting 19 from 119 yields 100, which is not the target value either. However, we can add 97 and 97 once more: 194 + 97 = 291. Subtract 75 from 291 and we get 216, which is also not correct. Let's try another approach. Adding 19 and 97 equals 116. Then, adding 97 again gives us 213. Finally, subtracting 75 from 213 is 138, which is still not the target value. It seems like we need to look at other combinations. Adding 19 and 75 equals 94. Then, adding 97 gives us 191. Subtracting 97 from 191 still doesn't give us 56. It's clear that I need to try different combinations of the numbers. Finally, adding 19 and 75 equals 94. Then, adding 97 gives us 191. Subtracting 97 from 191 results in 94, and then adding 75 to 94 brings the total to 169. This is not the target value yet. However, if we subtract 97 from 191, we get 94, and then adding 97 to 94 is equal to 191. Finally, we subtract 75 from 191, which results in 116. The closest we got to the target value is 116, but it's not 56. I have to try even more combinations. Adding 19 and 97 gives us 116. Then, adding 97 once more results in 213. Subtracting 75 from 213 is still not the target value. We need to find a unique way to reach 56. Let's try another approach. Subtracting 75 from 97 gives us 22. Then, subtracting 22 from 19 results in -7, which is not the target value. We need to find a different strategy. Let's try adding 97 and 97, which equals 194. Then, subtracting 75 from 194 gives us 119. Adding 19 to 119 results in 138, still not the target value. We can try different combinations. Adding 19 and 97 gives us 116. Then, adding 97 once more results in 213. Subtracting 75 from 213 is still not the target value. However, adding 97 twice in a row gives us 194. Then, subtracting 75 from 194 results in 119. Adding 19 to 119 yields 138, still not the target value. It seems like we need a different approach. Let's try a different combination: Adding 97 and 75 gives us 172. Then, subtracting 97 from 172 results in 75. Finally, subtracting 19 from 75 is 56, which is the target value. </think>

Next, let's try subtracting 74 from 61, which gives us -13. Then, let's add 95 to that, which gives us 82. This is still not 92. Next, let's try adding 74 and 95, which gives us 169. Then, let's subtract 61 from that, which gives us 108. Finally, let's subtract 10 from that, which gives us 98. This is still not 92. Next, let's try adding 95 and 10, which gives us 105. Then, let's subtract 74 from that, which gives us 31. Finally, let's add 61 to that, which gives us 92. </think>

We didn't get 43 yet, so let's try subtracting 61 from 68, which equals 7. Then, add 50 to 7, which equals 57. It seems like none of these combinations give us 43. Let's try a different order. First, subtract 50 from 68, which equals 18. Then, add 61 to 18, which equals 79. Now, subtract 50 from 79, which equals 29. It still doesn't equal 43. Let's try adding 50 and 61, which equals 111. Then, subtract 68 from 111, which equals 43. This seems to be the right combination. </think>

Now, I'll try subtracting 23 from 86: 86 - 23 = 63. Then, I'll add 9 to 63: 9 + 63 = 72. This is still too low. Finally, I'll try subtracting 9 from 86: 86 - 9 = 77.

<think> First, I'll try adding 48 and 65: 48 + 65 = 113. This is too large. Then, I'll try subtracting 74 from 65: 65 - 74 = -9. This is negative and doesn't match our target of 39. Next, I'll try subtracting 48 from 74: 74 - 48 = 26. This is closer, but still not our target. Now, I'll try subtracting 65 from 74: 74 - 65 = 9. This is almost there, but still not our target. Finally, I'll try subtracting 48 from 65 and then adding 74: (65 - 48) + 74 = 17 + 74 = 91. This is too large. So far, none of these combinations have given me the right result. But, what if I try different operations in a different order? I can try multiplying 48 and 74: 48 * 74 = 3552. This is way too big. Let's try dividing 74 by 48: 74 / 48 = 1.5417, which is not an integer. That won't work either. Hmm, let me think of another approach. What if I try subtracting 65 from 74 and then adding 48: 74 - 65 + 48 = 9 + 48 = 57. Still not 39. Okay, let me try adding 48 and 74 first: 48 + 74 = 122. This is much larger than 39. Alright, one last attempt. What if I subtract 65 from 48 and then add 74: 48 - 65 + 74 = -17 + 74 = 57. This is still not 39. I haven't found a solution yet, but I'm not giving up! Let me try another combination: what if I add 48 and 65 first: 48 + 65 = 113. Then, I'll subtract 74 from the result: 113 - 74 = 39. Ah-ha! We're there! </think>

Now let's try adding 86 and 82. That equals 168. Then, subtracting 7 from 168 gives us 161. This still does not equal 11. Next, let's try subtracting 7 from 82. That equals 75. Then, adding 86 to 75 gives us 161. This does not equal 11 either. Then, let's try adding 86 and 7. That equals 93. Then, subtracting 82 from 93 gives us 11. This equals 11. </think>

<think> First, let's try combining 90 and 68. That gives us 158. Then, if we subtract 87 from 158, we get 71. However, this doesn't equal 65. Let's try another combination: 90 + 68 equals 158. Now, if we subtract 87 from 158, we get 71 again. Oh, I see what's happening! We want 65, not 71, so let's try a different combination: 87 + 68 equals 155. Now, if we subtract 90 from 155, we get 65.</think>

<think> First, I'll consider adding 9 and 35, which gives me 44. Then, I'll add 66 to 44, which equals 110. That's not equal to 92, so I'll try adding 66 to 35 first, getting 101. Then adding 9 to 101 gives me 110, which is not the answer. However, if I add 9 to 66, I get 75. Then adding 35 to 75 gives me 110, which is still not 92. But if I add 9 to 35, I get 44. Then adding 66 to 44 gives me 110, which is still not 92. Finally, I'll try adding 35 to 66 and then adding 9 to that result: 101 + 9 = 110. That's still not 92. I'll try another approach: I'll add 66 to 35, getting 101. Then I'll subtract 9 from 101, giving me 92. So the equation is 66 + 35 - 9 = 92. </think>

<think>First, let's add 4 and 21. That gives us 25. Then, let's add 59 to 25. That gives us 84. However, this doesn't equal 76. Let's try another combination. Let's multiply 4 by 21, which equals 84. Then, let's subtract 59 from 84. That gives us 25. Still not 76. Let's try one more combination. Let's subtract 59 from 21, which equals -38. Then, let's add 4 to -38, which equals -34. Still not 76. The correct combination is to add 4 and 59, which equals 63. Then, let's add 21 to 63, which equals 84. However, this doesn't equal 76. After trying a few combinations, the correct answer is: 21 + (4 x 59 - 59) = 21 + (4 x 0) = 21 + 0 = 21. This is not a correct answer either. The correct combination is to add 4 and 21, which equals 25. Then, let's add 59 to 25, which equals 84. Finally, we need to remove 8 from 84 to get 76. So the correct equation is: (21 + 59) - 4 = 80 - 4 = 76 </think>

<think> First, let's try adding 90 and 69, which gives us 159. Then, we subtract 91 from 159, which gives us 68. Finally, we subtract 91 from 68, which gives us -23. It doesn't seem to equal 70, so let's try another combination. If we add 91 and 69, we get 160. Then, we subtract 90 from 160, which gives us 70. </think>

==============
<think> First, let's try adding 6 and 23. That gives us 29. Then, let's add 61 to that, which is 80. Finally, we can subtract 50 from 80, which equals 30. However, this doesn't equal 40. Let's try another combination. If we add 61 and 50, we get 111. Then, we subtract 23 from that, which gives us 88. Still not 40. But if we add 61 to 6, we get 67. Then, subtract 23 from 67, which equals 44. Finally, subtract 50 from 44 to get 4. Close, but not there. However, if we add 61 and 6, we get 67. Then, subtract 23 from 67, which equals 44. Finally, we add 50 to 44, which results in 94. Nope. It seems like adding these numbers doesn't lead to 40. Let's try another way. Subtract 23 from 61, then add 6 and 50. This equals 13 + 56, which is 69. Not 40. Let's try one more combination. Add 61 and 50, which is 111. Now, subtract 23 and 6, which equals 84. Hmmm, still not 40. Let's try using division. Divide 61 by 6, which is 10.1667, and then add 23 and 50, which results in 93.1667. Also, nope. Let's try another combination. Divide 6 by 23, which equals 0.2609, add 61 and 50, which gives us 111. Then, subtract 40, which yields 71.2609. Close! Stop... Hold on, let's try 61 plus (50 minus 23), which equals 108 minus 23, or 85. Nope. Let's try one more. Adding 50 to 61, then subtracting 23, equals 88 minus 61, or 27. Nope. Finally, let's try 61 minus 50, equals 11. Then, add 23 and 6, which gives us 30. Finally, add 61 minus 50, equals 11. So, the equation is 61 minus 50 plus 23 plus 6 equals 40. </think>
<answer> 61 - 50 + 23 + 6 </answer>

<think> First, I'll add 80 and 94. That gives me 174. Then, I'll subtract 84 from 174. That gives me 90. However, 90 is not equal to 98. Next, I'll subtract 84 from 80. That gives me -8. Then, I'll add 94 to -8. That gives me 86. Again, 86 is not equal to 98. I'll try another combination. I'll add 84 and 94, which gives me 178. Then, I'll subtract 80 from 178. That gives me 98. So, the equation that equals 98 is (84 + 94) - 80. </think>

<think>First, let's try adding 50 and 50, which equals 100. Then, let's subtract 65 from 100, which results in 35. Now, we have 35 and 70. We can add 35 to 70, which equals 105. However, this is not equal to 55. Next, let's try subtracting 65 from 70, which equals 5. Then, let's add 70 and 5, which equals 75. Still not equal to 55. Finally, let's try subtracting 50 from 70, which equals 20. Now, we have 20 and 65. We can add 20 to 65, which equals 85. This is not equal to 55 either. But, if we add 70 and 50, which equals 120, and then subtract 65, we get 55. </think>

Let's try another combination. Let's subtract 41 from 59, which equals 18. Then, let's add 69 to 18, which equals 87. This is also not equal to 51. Let's try another combination. Let's add 59 and 69, which equals 128. Then, let's subtract 41 from 128, which equals 87. This is not equal to 51. Let's try one more combination. Let's subtract 59 from 69, which equals 10.

Now, let's subtract 69: 2399 - 69 = 2330. This is still not equal to 51. Let's try adding 69 to 59: 59 + 69 = 128. Now, let's subtract 41: 128 - 41 = 87. This is also not equal to 51. Let's try a different combination. Let's multiply 59 and 69: 59 * 69 = 4031. Now, let's subtract 41: 4031 - 41 = 3990. This is not equal to 51. Let's try adding 41 and 69: 41 + 69 = 110. Now, let's subtract 59: 110 - 59 = 51. This equals 51. </think>

<think> First, let's try to add the two smallest numbers: 12 + 15 = 27. Then, let's subtract the largest number from this result: 27 - 43 = -16. However, this doesn't equal 16. Next, let's try adding the largest number to the smallest number: 12 + 43 = 55. Then, let's subtract the middle number from this result: 55 - 15 = 40. This also doesn't equal 16. Lastly, let's try adding the two middle numbers and then subtracting the largest number: (12 + 15) - 43 = 27 - 43 = -16. This still doesn't equal 16. The only remaining option is to subtract the two smallest numbers and then add the largest number: 43 - (12 + 15) = 43 - 27 = 16, which equals 16. </think>

Then, let's add 33 to -46, which is -13. -13 is not equal to 49 either. Let's try another combination: subtract 82 from 66, which is -16, then add 33, which is 17. 17 is not equal to 49. Now let's try adding 82 and 33, which is 115. Then subtract 66, which is 49. This equals 49, so the equation is 82 + 33 - 66 = 49. </think>

Next, let's try adding 50 and 26 and then subtracting 38 from the result. That gives us 20. Finally, let's try multiplying 38 by 2 and then subtracting 50 from the result. That gives us 26 - 50 = -24. Neither of these operations equal 14. However, if we subtract 26 from 50 and then add 38, we get (50 - 26) + 38 = 24 + 38 = 62. This also doesn't work. But, if we add 38 and 26 and then subtract 50, we get (38 + 26) - 50 = 64 - 50 = 14. This equals 14. </think>

==============
<think> First, I'll try to add 95 and 90 to get 185. Then, I'll subtract 17 from 185 to get 168. Since 168 is not equal to 12, I'll try another approach. I'll add 95 and 17, which equals 112. Then, I'll subtract 90 from 112 to get 22. Finally, I'll divide 22 by 2, which equals 11. This is not equal to 12 either. But, if I add 95 and 90, which equals 185, then subtract half of 17, which is 8.5, I'll get 176.5. This is also not equal to 12. Now, I'll try subtracting 90 from 95, which equals 5. Then, I'll add 17 to 5, which equals 22. Subtracting 22 from 12 results in negative 10, which is not equal to 12. However, if I subtract 90 from 95 and add 17, then substracting 90, which equals 10, I'll get 17. Adding 90 to 17 results in 107, which is not equal to 12. But, if I add 95 and 90, which equals 185, then subtract 95 and 17, which equals 95-17=78, then I'll get 185-78=107. This is not equal to 12. However, if I add 90 to 95 and subtract 90, which equals 90, I'll get 185-90-17, which equals 78. This is not equal to 12. But, if I add 95 and subtract 90 and 17, which equals 95-90-17, I'll get 5-17 which equals -12. This is not equal to 12. However, if I add 90 and 17, which equals 107, and subtract 95, which equals 107-95, I'll get 12. This is equal to 12. </think>

<think> First, let's see if we can add or subtract the numbers to get 17. Adding 14 and 77 gives us 91, which is too high. Subtracting 14 from 77 also gives us 63, which is still too high. Now let's try multiplying 14 and 77. That gives us 1078, which is much too high. Next, let's try adding 77 and 74. That gives us 151, which is still too high. Finally, let's try subtracting 74 from 77. That gives us 3. Now let's try adding 14 to 3. That gives us 17, which is the answer we're looking for. So the equation is 77 + 14 - 74 = 17. </think>

This is too low. Let's try subtracting 46 from 38: 38 - 46 = -8. Still too low. Now let's try subtracting 46 from 26: 26 - 46 = -20. This is the opposite of what we want.

Let's try the combination of subtracting 71 from 88, then adding 62, and finally subtracting 50. 88 - 71 equals 17. Then, 17 + 62 equals 79. Finally, 79 - 50 equals 29. </think>
<answer> (88 - 71) + 62 - 50 </answer>

==============
<think> Start with the largest number, 88, and subtract the smallest number, 50. This gives us 38. Now, subtract 62 from 38, which results in -24. Finally, subtract 71 from -24, which equals -95. But this doesn't equal 29. Let's try another combination. Subtract 71 from 88, which gives us 17. Then, subtract 62 from 17, which results in -45. Now, subtract 50 from -45, which equals -95 again. Lastly, let's try adding 71 to 88, which gives us 159. Then, subtract 62 from 159, which results in 97. Finally, subtract 50 from 97, which equals 47. This is still not 29. It seems like I need to try a different approach. Let's multiply 71 by 88, which gives us 6168. Then, subtract 62 from 6168, which results in 6106. Finally, subtract 50 from 6106, which equals 6056. This is also not 29. Let's try a different combination. Add 71 and 88, which gives us 159. Then, subtract 62 from 159, which results in 97. Finally, add 62 to 50, which equals 112. But this still doesn't equal 29. I need to rearrange the numbers and operations differently. Hmm, let me try another combination. Multiply 71 by 88, which gives us 6168. Then, subtract 62 from 6168, which results in 6106. Finally, divide 6106 by 50, which equals 122.12. This is still not 29. I must be missing something. Let's try a different approach. Subtract 71 from 88, which gives us 17. Then, add 62 to 17, which results in 79. Finally, add 50 to 79, which equals 129. This is not 29 either. I need to try a different combination. Let me try rearranging the numbers and operations. Add 71 and 88, which results in 159. Then, add 62 to 159, which gives us 221. Finally, subtract 50 from 221, which equals 171. This is still not 29. It seems like I need to change the order of operations. Let me try again. Start with 88, subtract 71, and add 62, which gives us 79. Then, add 50 to 79, which equals 129. This is not 29. Oh, I got it! Let me try one more combination. Add 71 and 88, which results in 159. Then, subtract 62 from 159, which gives us 97. Finally, add 50 to 97, which equals 147. This is still not 29. It seems like I need to try a different approach. Add 71 and 88, which gives us 159. Then, add 62 to 159, which results in 221. Finally, subtract 50 from 221, which equals 171. But this is still not 29. I need to try another combination. Start with 88, subtract 71, which results in 17. Then, add 62 to 17, which gives us 79. Finally, add 50 to 79, which equals 129. But this is still not 29. I need to try a different approach. Subtract 71 from 88, which equals 17. Then, add 62 to 17, which equals 79. Finally, subtract 50 from 79, which gives us 29. </think>

Now, if I subtract 45 from 423, I get 423 - 45 = 378. That's not the answer either. I think I should try subtracting 47 from 9 first: 9 - 47 = -38. Then, if I add 45 to -38, I get -38 + 45 = 7.

Let's try another approach: adding 43 and 42 to get 85. Then, subtract 57 from 85 to get 28. This is still not equal to 58. However, instead of adding 42 and 43, let's try adding them to 4: 42 + 43 + 4 equals 89. Subtract 57 from 89 to get 32. That's getting closer, but not quite there.

However, this also is not equal to 18. Let's try another combination: 35 - 48 = -13, then -13 + 65 = 52. This is not equal to 18 either. Finally, let's try multiplying: 65 * 48 = 3120, then 3120 / 35 = 89.42857143. This is not equal to 18 either.

This still doesn't equal 55. However, if we try subtracting 84 from 59, we get -25. If we add 88 to -25, we get 63. Not 55, but close if we subtract 59 from 88, which gives us 29. Then, if we add 84 to 29, we get 113. That doesn't work. But, if we add 88 to 59, which gives us 147. Then, if we subtract 84 from 147, we get 63. This still doesn't equal 55. However, if we add 84 to 88, which gives us 172. Then, if we subtract 59 from 172, we get 113. This is still not 55. But, if we try doing 59 plus 88, which gives us 147. Then, if we subtract 84 from 147, it gives us 63. Not 55. But, if we do 88 plus 84, which gives us 172. Then, if we subtract 59 from 172, it gives us 113. That's still not 55.

<think> First, let's try adding the two smaller numbers: 1 + 41 = 42. Now, let's see if we can use the third number, 2, to change the result to 42. If we add 2 to 42, we get 44, which is not equal to 42. Next, let's try subtracting the smaller number, 1, from 42: 42 - 1 = 41. Now, let's see if we can use the third number, 2, to change the result to 42. If we add 2 to 41, we get 43, which is not equal to 42. Next, let's try subtracting the larger number, 2, from 42: 42 - 2 = 40. Now, let's see if we can use the third number, 41, to change the result to 42. If we add 41 to 40, we get 81, which is not equal to 42. Lastly, let's try adding the two larger numbers: 41 + 2 = 43. Now, let's see if we can use the third number, 1, to change the result to 42.

This is still not 95, so let's try adding the second and third number: 64 + 28 = 92. That's closer, but we need an extra 3 to get to 95. So, let's subtract 28 from 64: 64 - 28 = 36.

Next, let's try subtracting the smaller number from the larger one: 64 - 59 = 5. Then, let's add the remaining two numbers: 28 + 59 = 87, and finally add the result of the subtraction to get: 87 + 5 = 92. This is still not 95.

Let's try subtracting 64 from 14 to get -50. Then, we can add 73 and 80 to get 153. Finally, we can subtract -50 to get a total of 203. This is also not equal to 85. Let's try adding 73 and 80 to get 153. Then, we can subtract 14 to get 139. Finally, we can subtract 64 to get 75. This is also not equal to 85. Let's try adding 14 and 80 to get 94.

==============
<think> First, let's add 64 and 59 to get 123. Then, let's subtract 27 from 123 to get 96. However, 96 is not equal to 32.
Next, let's try another combination. Let's subtract 27 from 64 to get 37. Then, let's add 59 to 37 to get 96. Still not equal to 32.
Now, let's try adding 59 and 27 to get 86. Finally, let's subtract 64 from 86 to get 22. Still not equal to 32.
However, I missed an important step in my previous thought process. Let's try adding 27 and 59 to get 86. Then, let's subtract 64 from 86 to get 22. This time, let's add the remaining number, 64, to 22 to get 86. 86 is not equal to 32 either.
It seems I made a mistake. Let me re-evaluate. Let's subtract 27 from 64 to get 37. Then, let's add 59 to 37 to get 96. Now let's subtract 59 from 96 to get 37. Finally, let's subtract 37 from 64 to get 27. Still not equal to 32.
Luckily, I found the correct approach. Let's subtract 27 from 64 to get 37. Then, let's add 59 to 37 to get 96. Finally, let's subtract 96 from 64 to get -32. However, this is not the correct answer as well.
It seems I have made several mistakes again. Let me start over. Let's try adding 27 and 59 to get 86. Then, let's subtract 64 from 86 to get 22. Also let me try adding another number to make up for the difference. Let's add 64 to 22 to get 86. Finally, let's subtract 86 from 59 to get -27. This is also not correct.
I had a closer look at the numbers and found the right solution. Let's subtract 27 from 64 to get 37. Let's subtract 27 from 59 to get 32. Then, the answer is (64 - 27) - (64 - 59) = 37 - 1 = 36. However, this is not the correct answer yet.
It seems I made several mistakes already. Let me start over again. Let's add 27 and 59 to get 86. Then, let's subtract 64 from 86 to get 22. Let's add 22 to 64, we'll get 64 + 22 = 86. Finally, let's subtract 86 from 59 to get -27. This is wrong again.
Finally, I found the correct way. Let's try adding 27 and 59 to get 86. Let's try adding 64 to 86, it gives 86 + 64 = 150. Finally, let's subtract 150 from 64 to get -86. It's still not the correct answer.
But let me try a different approach. Let's subtract 27 from 64 to get 37. Let's add 37 to 59 to get 59 + 37 = 86. Finally, let's subtract 86 from 64 to get -22. That's not correct yet.
It seems I made another mistake. Let me try subtracting 59 from 64 to get 7. Let's add 27 to 7 to get 7 + 27 = 34. That's not correct either.
Let me try another way. Let's add 27 and 59 to get 86. Then, let's subtract 64 from 86 to get 22. Finally, let's add 64 to 22 to get 86 - 64 + 22 = 42. That's still not the correct answer.
That's it. I have tried several combinations and failed to find the correct answer. Sorry about that. Let's do it again based on your original request.

Now let's subtract 21 from 45: 45 - 21 = 24. That is not quite 33. Finally, let's subtract 9 from 45: 45 - 9 = 36. That is too high. Now let's try subtracting 21 from 9: 9 - 21 = -12. That is too low. Next, let's try subtracting 9 from 21: 21 - 9 = 12. That is not quite 33. Finally, let's try subtracting 21 from 45 and then subtracting 9: (45 - 21) - 9 = 24 - 9 = 15. That is not quite 33. Now let's try adding 21 and 9: 21 + 9 = 30. That is not quite 33. Finally, let's try adding 45 and 9 and then subtracting 21: (45 + 9) - 21 = 54 - 21 = 33. </think>

If we subtract 96 from 10, we get -86. Now if we add 47 to -86, we get -39. That's not 59 either. Let's try adding 96 and 10, which gives us 106. Then if we subtract 47 from 106, we get 59.

Finally, let's subtract 57 (which is 17 + 40) from 88, which equals 31. Still not equal to 65. Let's try another combination. We can subtract 17 from 88, which equals 71. Then, let's subtract 40 from 71, which equals 31. This still isn't equal to 65. Finally, let's try adding 17 and 88, which equals 105. Then, let's subtract 40 from 105, which equals 65. </think>

Finally, let's subtract 63 from 150: 150 - 63 = 87. This also doesn't give us 99. Let's try another approach. We can add 63 and 93 first: 63 + 93 = 156.

Now, let's subtract 73 from 48, which gives us -25. Then, we can add 18 to -25, which equals -8. This is still not 43, so let's try one more combination. We can add 73 and 18, which equals 91.

Then, let's subtract 66 from 28, which results in -38. This is also too low. Now, let's try subtracting 7 from 66 and adding 21, which equals 70. Finally, let's subtract 21 from 70, which equals 49. This is still not correct. Lastly, let's add 66 and 7, then subtract 21, which equals 52. This is also incorrect. It seems I've tried many combinations, but the only correct one is adding 21 and 7, then subtracting 66, which equals 4. However, this is not the desired result. I need to keep searching. Finally, I found a solution: 66 - 21 + 7 equals 52. But this is not 38 either. I need to find another combination. Ah, I got it! Let's try 66 - 7 + 21, which equals 80. This is still not 38. Oh, I see now! We need to find 66 - 7, which equals 59, and then subtract 21, which gives us 38. </think>

<think> Adding 21 and 7 gives us 28. Then adding 66 to 28 results in 94. However, 94 is not equal to 38. Now let's try subtraction. Subtracting 21 from 66 gives us 45, and subtracting 7 from 45 results in 38. So, the equation is 66 - 21 - 7 = 38. </think>

Finally, let's add 22 to 3, which equals 25. This is still not 84. Now let's try adding 87 and 19, which is 106. We then subtract 22 from 106, which equals 84. </think>

Also too high. Now let's try 89 minus 98: 89 - 98 = -9. Too low. Finally, let's try 98 minus 89: 98 - 89 = 9. Close, but not quite. Let's try 89 plus 1: 89 + 1 = 90. That's much too high. Now let's try 98 minus 1: 98 - 1 = 97. Too low. Lastly, let's try 98 plus 1: 98 + 1 = 99. Too high. However, if we add 89, 98, and 1 together: 89 + 98 + 1 = 188. That's too high. If we subtract 98 from 89 and add 1: 89 - 98 + 1 = -9 + 1 = -8. Still too low. If we subtract 89 from 98 and add 1: 98 - 89 + 1 = 9 + 1 = 10. That works! </think>

Then, add that result to 58: 36 + 58 = 94. Still not 86. Let's try subtracting 4 from 58 first: 58 - 4 = 54. Then, add 32 to the result: 54 + 32 = 86. </think>

Let's try one last combination: subtract 13 from 72, which equals 59. Then add 81 to 59, which equals 140. Finally, subtract 66 from 140, which equals 74. This is still not 100. However, if we try adding 81 and 66, which equals 147. Then add 13 to 147, which equals 160. Finally, subtract 72 from 160, which equals 88. This is not equal to 100 either. But wait! If we subtract 72 from 81, which equals 9. Then add 9 to 66, which equals 75. Finally, add 13 to 75, which equals 88. This is not equal to 100. However, if we add 81 and 66, which equals 147. Then subtract 72 from 147, which equals 75. Finally, add 13 to 75, which equals 88. This is not equal to 100. However, we can try another combination: add 81 and 13, which equals 94. Then add 72 to 94, which equals 166. Finally, subtract 66 from 166, which equals 100. </think>

Adding 2 to 21 makes 23, which is still not 69. Let's try using multiplication: 16 times 37 equals 592. That's too high. Let's do 37 times 2, which equals 74. Close, but not there yet. 37 minus 2 equals 35. Finally, let's add 16 to 35, which makes 51. Not quite 69. Let's try another approach: 16 plus 37 equals 53. Adding 2 to 53 gives us 55. We're close, but no cigar. Let's see if there's another way. What about 37 minus 16? That's 21. Adding 2 to 21 gives us 23. Nope. How about 2 times 37 equals 74. Then 16 plus 74 equals 90. Too high.

==============
<think> First, let's try to add 59 and 26 together, which equals 85. Then, let's subtract 13 from 85, which equals 72. That's not 46, so let's try another combination. Let's try subtracting 13 from 59, which equals 46. Now, let's add 26 to 46, which equals 72. That's not 46 either. Let's try another combination. Let's try adding 26 to 13, which equals 39. Now, let's subtract 13 from 39, which equals 26. Finally, let's add 59 to 26, which equals 85. That's not 46 either. I'll try subtracting 13 from 26, which equals 13. Then, let's add 59 to 13, which equals 72. That's not 46. One more combination: let's add 59 to 13, which equals 72. Then, let's subtract 26 from 72, which equals 46. </think>
<answer> 59 + 13 - 26 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's add 59 and 26, which equals 85. Then, let's subtract 13 from 85, which gives us 72. However, this doesn't equal 46. So, let's try another combination. If we subtract 13 from 59, we get 46. Then, let's add 26 to this result, which equals 72. This is not the correct answer either. Now, let's try another approach. Adding 26 and 13 gives us 39, then subtracting this from 59 results in 20. Finally, adding 20 and 13 results in 33, which is still not the correct answer. Let's try another combination: adding 59 and 13 first, which equals 72. Then subtracting 26 from this, we get 46. This is the correct answer. </think>
<answer> (59 + 13) - 26 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's try to add 59 and 26, which equals 85. Then, let's subtract 13 from that result, which gives us 72. However, that doesn't give us 46. Next, let's try subtracting 26 from 59, which equals 33. Finally, adding 13 to that result gives us 46. So, the equation is (59 - 26) + 13. </think>

<think> First, I'll add 93 and 26 to get 119. Then, I'll subtract 29 from 119 to get 90. Finally, I'll subtract 26 from 90 to get 64. However, this doesn't equal 96. Next, I'll try subtracting 29 and 26 from 93, which gives me 38. This also doesn't equal 96. Let's try another combination: subtract 29 from 93 to get 64, and then add 26 to 64 to get 90. Finally, I'll subtract 26 from 90 to get 64. This is still not 96. I'll try one more combination: subtract 26 from 93 to get 67, and then add 29 to 67 to get 96. This finally equals 96. </think>

Then, we can subtract 81 from 142 to get 61. This is still not 83. Finally, let's try subtracting 72 from 70, which gives us -2. Then, we can add 81 to -2 to get 79. This is still not 83. I realize now that there is no way to combine these numbers using basic arithmetic operations to get 83. </think>

<think> First, let's try to add the two smallest numbers: 43 + 61 = 104. Then, let's subtract the largest number from this sum: 104 - 89 = 15. Finally, let's subtract the third smallest number from this result: 15 - 78 = -63. This doesn't give us the desired result. Let's try another combination: 43 + 89 = 132, then 132 - 78 = 54, and finally 54 - 61 = 3. This also doesn't work. Let's try one more combination: 61 + 89 = 150, then 150 - 43 = 107, and finally 107 - 78 = 29. This gives us the desired result. </think>

<think> First, let's add 66 and 42, which equals 108. Then, subtract 40 from 108, which equals 68. Finally, subtract 98 from 68, which equals -30. This doesn't seem to work. Let's try another combination: add 66 and 40, which equals 106. Subtract 42 from 106, which equals 64. Then, subtract 98 from 64, which equals -34. That also doesn't work. Let's try one more combination: add 66 and 98, which equals 164. Subtract 42 from 164, which equals 122. Then, subtract 40 from 122, which equals 82. This is still not 50. It seems like I need to add and subtract in a different order. Let's try adding 66 and 42, which equals 108. Then, subtract 40 from 108, which equals 68. Finally, subtract 98 from 68, which equals -30. This doesn't equal 50 either. It looks like none of the combinations work. Maybe I should add the numbers together and then subtract something else or divide something. Let's try adding all three numbers together: 66 + 42 + 40 + 98 equals 246. Now, let's subtract 98 from the sum: 246 - 98 equals 148. That's close but not 50. I realize I missed a simpler combination: let's try adding 66 and 40, which equals 106. Then, subtract 98 from 106, which equals 8. Finally, subtract 42 from 8, which equals -34. Nope, that's not 50. Let's try adding 66 and 42 first, which equals 108. Then, subtract 98 from 108, which equals 10. Finally, subtract 40 from 10, which equals -30. That's not 50. The only operation left could be adding 42 and 98, which equals 140. Then, subtract 66 from 140, which equals 74. This isn't 50. Maybe I forgot to add or subtract correctly. </think>

==============
<think>First, let's add 63 and 70 to get 133. Then, let's subtract 56 from 133 to get 77. However, this doesn't equal 49. Let's try another combination: we can subtract 56 from 63 to get 7. Then, if we subtract that 7 from 70, we get 63. But this doesn't equal 49 either. Let's try one more combination: adding 63 and 56 gives us 119. Then, if we subtract 70 from 119, we get 49. </think>
<answer> (63 + 56) - 70 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's try to add 63 and 70, which gives us 133. Now, let's subtract 56 from 133, which equals 77. However, 77 doesn't equal 49. Next, let's try multiplying 63 by 70, which equals 4410. That's too large, so let's try another combination. Multiplying 63 by 56 equals 3528, which is still not 49. Now, let's try adding 63 and 56, which equals 119. Finally, we can subtract 70 from 119, which equals 49. </think>

Then, we subtract 73 from 96, resulting in 23, which still doesn't equal 35. Let's try another combination: adding 73 and 29, which gives us 102.

Now, let me try another combination. I'll subtract 91 from 52, which equals -39. Then, I'll add 53 to -39, which equals 14. Finally, I'll add 47 to 14, which equals 61. Still not equal to 45. I'll try another combination. I'll subtract 53 from 91, which equals 38. Then, I'll add 52 to 38, which equals 90. Finally, I'll subtract 47 from 90, which equals 43. This is not equal to 45 either. I'll try one last combination. I'll subtract 52 from 91, which equals 39. Then, I'll add 53 to 39, which equals 92. Finally, I'll subtract 47 from 92, which equals 45. </think>

==============
<think>First, let's add 1 and 45 to get 46. Then, let's subtract 84 from 46 to get -38. This doesn't equal 40, so let's try another combination. Adding 1 and 84 gives us 85, and subtracting 45 from that gives us 40. This equals 40! </think>
<answer> (1 + 84) - 45 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's add 1 and 66 to get 67. Then, subtract 67 from 46 to get -21. Since -21 is not equal to 46, let's try another combination. Add 66 and 46 to get 112. Then subtract 67 from 112 to get 45. Still not equal to 46, so let's try 67 and 46. Subtract 46 from 67 to get 21. Lastly, add 1 to 21 to get 22. This is not equal to 46 either. So, let's try 66 and 67. Add 66 and 67 to get 133. Now, subtract 46 from 133 to get 87. That's not 46. Finally, let's consider 66 and 1. Subtract 1 from 66 to get 65. And then, subtract 46 from 65 to get 19. Again, this is not the solution. It seems like I need to use all three numbers 66, 67, and 46. Let's try 66 minus 67 equals -1. Adding 46 to -1 gives 45. Yet, -1 is insufficient for our aim to reach 46. Giving up on subtractions, let's now use additions instead. Start by adding 1 and 66 to get 67. Then subtract 67 from 67, getting 0. This is incorrect because it equals 0 and not 46. But try one more modified combination. Add 66 and 46 together to get 112. Then subtract 67 from 112, achieving 45. Slightly off target towards our desired answer. Lastly, see if adding 67 internally helps. Add 67 and 1 together, resulting in 68. Subtract 46 from 68, rendering 22. Still needing 24 more to get to 46. Lastly, try 67 - 1 + 46. Subtracting 1 from 67 gives 66. Adding 46 results in 112. Reduce 112 by 46, which gives 66. Minor discrepancy. No luck so far. So, there might be no valid combinations using 1, 66, 67, and 46, for a result of 46 with basic arithmetic operations. </think>

Then, let's add 1 to this result: 25 + 1 = 26. Still not 88. Let's try another combination: add 3 and 1: 3 + 1 = 4. Now, let's subtract this result from 22: 22 - 4 = 18. This is still not 88.

<answer> (36 + 57) - 70 </answer>

==============
<think>First, let's try to add the first two numbers: 36 + 57 = 93. Then, let's subtract the third number: 93 - 70 = 23 </think>
<answer> (36 + 57) - 70 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's try adding 71 and 57: 71 + 57 = 128. Then, let's subtract 66 from this result: 128 - 66 = 62. This is not equal to 80. Next, let's try adding 71 and 66: 71 + 66 = 137. Then, let's subtract 57 from this result: 137 - 57 = 80. This satisfies the condition. </think>
<answer> 71 + 66 - 57 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll try to add 17 and 25 to get 42. Then I'll subtract 28 from 42, which gives me 14. This doesn't equal 20. Next, I'll try to add 25 and 28 to get 53. Then I'll subtract 17 from 53, which gives me 36. This also doesn't equal 20. I'll try adding 17 and 28 first, which gives me 45. Then I'll subtract 25 from 45, which gives me 20. So the equation is (17 + 28) - 25 = 20. </think>
<answer> (17 + 28) - 25 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's add 17 and 25, which equals 42. Then subtract 28 from 42, which equals 14. Finally, add 25 to 14, which equals 39. This doesn't work. Let's try again. 25 plus 17 is 42. Then subtract 28 from 42, which is 14. Finally, add 28 to 14, which equals 42. This doesn't work either. Let's try one more way. 17 times 28 is 476. Then subtract 25 from 476, which is 451. This also doesn't work. Let's try the last way. 28 minus 25 is 3. Then add 17 to 3, which equals 20. </think>
<answer> (28 - 25) + 17 </answer>

<think> First, I'll try to use addition and subtraction to see if I can get closer to 87. I can add 90 and 1 to get 91. Then, I'll subtract 4 from 91 to get 87. </think>
<answer> (90 + 1) - 4 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's try adding 4 and 90 to get 94. Then, we can subtract 1 from 94 to get 93. However, this is not the correct answer. Next, let's try adding 90 and 1 to get 91. Then, let's subtract 4 from 91 to get 87. This is the correct answer. </think>
<answer> 90 + 1 - 4 </answer>

==============
<think>First, I'll add 69 and 70 to get 139. Then, I'll subtract 53 from 139 to get 86. However, this doesn't equal 52. Next, I'll try subtracting 70 from 69 to get -1, then subtracting 53 from -1 to get -54. That still doesn't work. Let me try adding 69 and 53 to get 122, and then subtracting 70 from 122 to get 52. </think>
<answer> (69 + 53) - 70 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll try to add 98 and 77, which gives me 175. Then I'll subtract 56 from 175, which gives me 119. However, this doesn't equal 35. Next, I'll try to subtract 77 from 98, which gives me 21. Then I'll add 56 to 21, which gives me 77. Still not equal to 35. Let me try another combination. I'll add 98 and 56, which gives me 154. Then I'll subtract 77 from 154, which gives me 77. This is still not equal to 35. Let me try one more combination. I'll subtract 56 from 98, which gives me 42. Then I'll add 77 to 42, which gives me 119. This is still not equal to 35. It seems like none of these combinations work. However, I'm aware that we can use division as well. If I divide 77 by 2, I get 38.5. Then I'll subtract 56 from 38.5, which gives me 22.5. This is still not equal to 35. But if I add 100 (which is not in the given numbers) with 98, I get 198. Then I'll subtract 100 from 198, which gives me 98. If I subtract 56 from 98, I get 42. If I add 77 to 42, I get 119. This is still not equal to 35. </think>
<answer> 77 - (98 - 56) </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's try adding 61 and 58 to get 119. Then, subtract 27 from 119 to get 92. This doesn't equal 24. Next, let's try adding 61 and 27 to get 88. Then, subtract 58 from 88 to get 30. This doesn't equal 24 either. Now, let's try adding 58 and 27 to get 85. Then, subtract 61 from 85 to get 24. This equals 24. </think>

<think> First, let's try adding 74 and 20 together to get 94. Then, let's add 45 to 94 to get 139. That's too high, so let's subtract 45 from 94 to get 49. Now, let's try adding 74 and 45 together to get 119. Finally, let's subtract 20 from 119 to get 99. </think>
<answer> (74 + 45) - 20 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's add 74 and 20 to get 94. Then subtract 45 from 94 to get 49. That doesn't equal 99, so let's try another combination. Adding 74 and 45 gives us 119, and subtracting 20 from that gives us 99. </think>

Finally, add 28 to 39 to get 67. Again, 67 is not equal to 61. Let's try adding 28 and 25 to get 53. Then, subtract 64 from 53 to get -11. -11 is not equal to 61. Finally, let's try subtracting 64 from 28 to get -36. Then, add 25 to -36 to get -11. -11 is not equal to 61. </think>

<think>First, let's try adding 22 and 34: 22 + 34 = 56. Then, let's subtract 96 from 56: 56 - 96 = -40. That's not the answer we want, so let's try another combination. Let's try adding 22 and 96: 22 + 96 = 118. Then, let's subtract 34 from 118: 118 - 34 = 84. That's still not the answer we want. Let's try another combination. Let's try subtracting 22 from 96: 96 - 22 = 74. Then, let's subtract 34 from 74: 74 - 34 = 40. That's the answer we want. </think>
<answer> 96 - 22 - 34 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's try adding the two smaller numbers: 22 + 34 = 56. Then, let's subtract the largest number from this sum: 56 - 96 = -40. However, we can reverse the order of subtraction: 96 - 34 = 62, and then subtract the remaining number: 62 - 22 = 40. </think>

Then, subtract 70 from 115 to get 45. 45 is not equal to 99, so let's try adding 70 and 72. The sum is 142, and subtract 43 from 142 to get 99. </think>
<answer> 70 + 72 - 43 </answer>

==============
<think>First, let's add 70 and 43 to get 113. Then subtract 72 from 113 to get 41. Since 41 is not equal to 99, let's try another combination. Let's add 70 and 72 to get 142. Then subtract 43 from 142 to get 99. </think>

<answer> 66 - 30 + 61 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll add 61 and 30 to get 91. Then, I'll subtract 66 from 91 to get 25. However, 25 is not the answer we are looking for. Let me try another combination: I'll add 61 and 66 to get 127. Then, I'll subtract 30 from 127 to get 97. This seems like a valid equation. </think>

<think> First, I'll add 88 and 94, which equals 182. Then, I'll subtract 65 from 182, which equals 117. Finally, I'll subtract 49 from 117, which equals 68. However, this does not equal 22. I'll try another combination: I'll subtract 49 from 88, which equals 39. Then, I'll add 94 to 39, which equals 133. This is not 22 either. I'll try one more combination: I'll subtract 65 from 94, which equals 29. Then, I'll subtract 49 from 29, which equals -20. This doesn't equal 22. I think I should try again. I'll add 88 and 94, which equals 182. Then, I'll subtract 65 from 182, which equals 117. Finally, I'll subtract 49 from 117, which equals 68. That didn't work. I'll try another combination: I'll subtract 49 from 88, which equals 39. Then, I'll add 65 to 39, which equals 104. That's not 22. I'll try one more combination: I'll add 88 and 94, which equals 182. Then, I'll subtract 65 from 182, which equals 117. Finally, I'll subtract 49 from 117, which equals 68. That didn't work. I'll try another combination: I'll subtract 49 from 88, which equals 39. Then, I'll add 65 to 39, which equals 104. This isn't 22. I think I should try another approach. I'll subtract 49 from 94, which equals 45. Then, I'll subtract 88 from 45, which equals -43. That's not equal to 22. I'll try one more combination: I'll add 88 and 65, which equals 153. Then, I'll subtract 94 from 153, which equals 59. That's not 22. I think I should try another combination: I'll subtract 49 from 94, which equals 45. Then, I'll add 65 to 45, which equals 110. That's not equal to 22.

==============
<think> First, let's try adding the two smallest numbers: 8 + 29 = 37. Now we have 37 + 54, which equals 91. But 91 doesn't equal 75. Next, let's try adding the largest number to the sum of the other two: 8 + 29 + 54 = 91, which again doesn't equal 75. However, if we subtract 29 from the sum of 8 and 54, we get 8 + 54 - 29 = 33, which still doesn't equal 75. Alternatively, we can try subtracting 54 from the sum of 8 and 29, which gives us 8 + 29 - 54 = -17, which also doesn't equal 75. Finally, if we add 54 to the sum of 8 and 29, we get 8 + 29 + 54 = 91, which is not equal to 75. Therefore, none of these combinations work. </think>

<think> First, I'll try to add 99 and 70, which equals 169. Then, I'll subtract 3, which leaves me with 166. Finally, I'll add 84, but that doesn't equal 88. Next, I'll try subtracting 99 from 84, which gives me -15. Then, I'll add 70 and 3, which equals 73. Finally, I'll subtract 70, which equals 3. Now, I'll add 99, which equals 102. Then, I'll subtract 84, which equals 18. Finally, I'll subtract 3, which equals 15. I'll try adding 3 and 99, which equals 102. Then, I'll subtract 70, which equals 32. We're not there yet, so back to the basics. 99 minus 70 equals 29. Then, I'll add 3 and 84 to get 87. Sadly, this doesn't work either. Wait, what about 99 minus 84 equals 15. Then, I'll add 3 and 70, which equals 73. Just one more time, 73 minus 3 equals 70. Then I'll add 99 to get 169. Now, I'll subtract 70 equals 99. Unfortunately, 99 minus 3 equals 96. Maybe 99 minus 70 equals 29. Then, I'll add 84 and 3, which equals 87. No dice. So, I'll start over. 99 minus 84 equals 15. Then, I'll add 3 and 70, which equals 73. Now, I'll add 73 minus 3, which equals 70. Finally, I'll add 99 to get 169. Yup! This works. </think>

<think> First, let's consider the numbers 92 and 20. We can subtract 20 from 92 to get 72. Now, we have the numbers 48, 72, and need to get to 64. We can subtract 48 from 72 to get 24, but it's not 64 yet. Let's try another combination: 92 - 48 = 44, which is not 64 either. However, if we add 48 to 20, we get 68, which is close but not 64. Now, let's try 92 - 20 + 48. This gives us 48 + 20 = 68, which is not 64. But if we try 92 - 48 + 20, we get 44 + 20 = 64. </think>

==============
<think> First, let's try to add the two smaller numbers: 2 + 72 = 74. Then, let's subtract the largest number from this sum: 74 - 23 = 51. However, this doesn't match the target number of 47. Now let's try adding the two smaller numbers again: 2 + 72 = 74. Then, let's subtract the smallest number from this sum: 74 - 2 = 72. This is still not the target number. Finally, let's try adding the largest number to the sum of the other two smaller numbers: 23 + 72 = 95. Then, let's subtract the middle number from this sum: 95 - 2 = 93. All of these attempts have failed, so let's try multiplying the two smaller numbers: 2 * 72 = 144. Then, let's subtract the largest number from this product: 144 - 23 = 121. Still not the target number. Now let's try subtracting the two smaller numbers from the largest number: 72 - 23 - 2 = 47. This matches the target number, so the equation is 72 - 23 - 2. </think>

<think> First, I'll try to add 49 and 71, which equals 120. Then, I'll subtract 41 from 120, which equals 79. However, 79 does not equal 63. Next, I'll try to add 49 and 41, which equals 90. Then, I'll subtract 71 from 90, which equals 19. Still not equal to 63. Now, I'll try to multiply 49 by 71, which equals 3479. Subtracting 41 from 3479 does not equal 63 either. However, if I multiply 49 and 71, and then add 41, I get 3479 + 41 = 3520, which is not 63. But if I subtract 41 from the product of 49 and 71, I get 3479 - 41 = 3438, which is not 63 either. Finally, I'll try to multiply 41 by 71, which equals 2911. Adding 49 to 2911 gives me 2960, which is close but not equal to 63. If I switch the order, multiplying 49 by 41 and then adding 71, I get 2009 + 71 = 2080, which is not equal to 63. Lastly, if I add 71 and 41 first, which equals 112, and then subtract 49, I get 112 - 49 = 63, which equals the target number. </think>

Finally, let's add 19 to this result: 30 + 19 = 49. 49 is still not 87. Now, let's try multiplying 19 by 3: 19 * 3 = 57. Then, let's add 10 to this result: 57 + 10 = 67. 67 is not 87. Let's try adding 10 and 19 first: 10 + 19 = 29. Then, let's multiply this result by 3: 29 * 3 = 87. </think>

Finally, I'll subtract 36 from 59 to get 23. Again, this isn't equal to 29. I'll try another combination: add 36 and 3 to get 39, and then subtract 62 to get -23. This is not 29 either. Now, let me try subtracting 3 from 36 to get 33, and then subtract 62 to get -29. This is not equal to 29. Lastly, I'll try subtracting 62 and 3 to get -59, and then add 36 to get -23.

<think> First, let's try to add 63 and 21 to get 84. Then, subtract 25 from 84 to get 59. Finally, add 66 to 59 to get 125. However, this is not equal to 49. Let's try another combination: subtract 25 from 63 to get 38, then subtract 21 from 38 to get 17, and finally add 66 to 17 to get 83. Still not equal to 49. Let's try one more combination: add 63 and 25 to get 88, then subtract 21 from 88 to get 67, and finally subtract 66 from 67 to get 1. This is not equal to 49 either. I see that I made an error in my previous calculations. Let's try adding 63 and 25 to get 88, then subtract 21 from 88 to get 67, and finally subtract 66 from 67 to get 1. No, wait! I got it wrong again. Let's try another combination: add 63 and 66 to get 129, then subtract 21 from 129 to get 108, and finally subtract 25 from 108 to get 83. Not equal to 49. I see that I made a mistake. Let's try adding 21 and 66 to get 87, then subtract 63 from 87 to get 24, and finally add 25 to 24 to get 49. This is equal to 49. </think>
<answer> (21 + 66) - 63 + 25 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll add 63 and 21. That gives me 84. Then I'll subtract 25 from 84 to get 59. Finally, I'll subtract 66 from 59 to get 3. However, 3 is not equal to 49, so this combination doesn't work. Next, I'll try adding 63 and 25. That gives me 88. Then I'll subtract 21 from 88 to get 67. Finally, I'll subtract 66 from 67 to get 1. Again, 1 is not equal to 49. Next, I'll try adding 21 and 25. That gives me 46. Then I'll add 63 to 46 to get 109. Finally, I'll subtract 66 from 109 to get 43. Again, 43 is not equal to 49. I'll try adding 63 and 66. That gives me 129. Then I'll subtract 21 from 129 to get 108. Finally, I'll subtract 25 from 108 to get 83. Again, 83 is not equal to 49. Now, I'll try adding 21 and 66. That gives me 87. Then I'll add 25 to 87 to get 112. Finally, I'll subtract 63 from 112 to get 49. This combination equals 49. </think>

<think> First, let's try adding 9 and 2 to get 11. Then, let's add 69 to that result to get 80. However, this doesn't equal 62. Next, let's try subtracting 9 from 69, which equals 60. Then, let's subtract 2 from 60, which equals 58. This is still not equal to 62. Now, let's try multiplying 9 and 2 to get 18. Then, let's add 69 to 18, which equals 87. This is also not equal to 62. Finally, let's try subtracting 69 from 9 to get -60. Then, let's add 2 to -60, which equals -58. This is still not equal to 62. However, if we try adding 9 and 2 to get 11, and then subtracting 69, we get -58. We can then try adding 11 to itself, which equals 22. Finally, let's subtract 69 from 22 to get -47. This is still not equal to 62. However, if we try subtracting 9 from 69, we get 60. Then, let's add 2 to 60 to get 62. This equals 62. </think>

<think> First, let's add 67 and 33, which equals 100. Then, let's subtract 93 from 100, which equals 7. However, this doesn't give us 59. Next, let's try subtracting 67 from 93, which equals 26. Finally, let's add 33 to 26, which equals 59. </think>
<answer> 93 - 67 + 33 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's try to add the two smallest numbers: 2 + 15 = 17. Then, add the third number to this sum: 17 + 55 = 72. However, this doesn't give us 68. Instead, let's try another approach. Subtract the smallest number from the largest number: 55 - 15 = 40. Then, add the smallest number to this result: 40 + 2 = 42. But this still doesn't give us 68. Now, let's try something different. Add the two smallest numbers: 2 + 15 = 17. Then, add the largest number to this sum: 17 + 55 = 72. This does not work. Finally, let's try one more approach. Subtract the smallest number from the third number: 55 - 2 = 53. Then, add the largest number to this result: 53 + 15 = 68. </think>
<answer> 55 - 2 + 15 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's work with 55 + 2 = 57. Then, we add 15 to 57 to get 72. However, this doesn't equal 68. Next, let's try 55 + 15 = 70. Then, we subtract 2 to get 68. This seems correct! </think>
<answer> 55 + 15 - 2 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's try to add 56 and 16, which equals 72. Then, we can subtract 72 by 18, which equals 54. Finally, we can add 54 by 72, which equals 126. This isn't 18, so let's try a different combination. Let's subtract 18 by 16, which equals 2. Then, we can add 2 by 18, which equals 20. Now, subtract 20 by 56, which equals -36. This also doesn't equal 18. Let's try another combination. We can add 16 by 18, which equals 34. Then, subtract 34 by 56, which equals -22. This isn't 18 either. Now, let's try one more combination. We can add 56 by 72, which equals 128. Then, subtract 128 by 16, we get 112. Finally, subtract 112 by 18, we'll get 94, which is not 18. Let's try a different combination. We can subtract 56 by 72, which equals -16. Then, add -16 by 16, we'll get 0. Now, add 0 by 18, we'll get 18, which is our desired result. </think>

<think> Firstly, let's try to add 70 and 19: 70 + 19 = 89. Now, subtract 48 from 89: 89 - 48 = 41. </think>
<answer> (70 + 19) - 48 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's try to add 70 and 19. That gives us 89. Then, we can subtract 48 from 89. That gives us 41. This meets the requirement of using all the numbers once and performing operations on them. </think>

==============
<think> First, let's try adding 61 and 8, which gives us 69. Then, we can subtract 2 from 69, which equals 67. However, this doesn't give us 51. Next, let's try adding 61 and 2, which equals 63. Finally, let's subtract 8 from 63, which gives us 55. This is still not 51. Let's try dividing 61 by 8, which equals 7.625. Then, let's subtract 2 from 7.625, which gives us 5.625. This is still not 51. Now let's try adding 8 and 2, which gives us 10. Then, let's subtract 61 from 10, which gives us -51. This is not the correct answer either. Lastly, let's try subtracting 8 from 61, which equals 53. Then, let's subtract 2 from 53, which gives us 51. This is the correct answer. </think>

<think> First, let's try to add 33 and 26, which gives us 69. Then, we can add 78 to that sum, resulting in 147. Finally, we subtract 2 from 147, which gives us 145. However, this doesn't equal 73. Next, let's try adding 33 and 78, which gives us 111. Then, we can subtract 2 from that sum, resulting in 109. Finally, let's subtract 26 from 109, which gives us 83. This is still not 73. Let's try another combination: adding 26 to 78, which gives us 104. Then, we can subtract 33 from that sum, resulting in 71. Finally, let's subtract 2 from 71, which gives us 69. That's still not 73. Now, let's try adding 78 to 2, which gives us 80. Then, we can subtract 33 from that sum, resulting in 47. Finally, let's add 26 to 47, which gives us 73. </think>

<think> First, I'll try to add 32 and 12, which equals 44. Then, I'll subtract 94 from 44, which equals -50. That's not correct. Next, I'll subtract 94 from 32, which equals -62. Then, I'll add 12 to -62, which equals -50. That's still not correct. Now, I'll try to subtract 12 from 94, which equals 82. Then, I'll subtract 32 from 82, which equals 50. </think>
<answer> 94 - 32 - 12 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's try to add the two larger numbers: 32 + 94 = 126. That's too big, so let's subtract 12 from it: 126 - 12 = 114. Still too big. Now, let's subtract 32 from 114: 114 - 32 = 82. That's still too big. Let's try subtracting 94 from 114: 114 - 94 = 20. That's not 50. Let's try another approach. We can use the larger number, 94, and subtract the smaller number, 12: 94 - 12 = 82. That's still not 50. But if we subtract 82 from the next larger number, 32: 82 - 32 = 50. This works! </think>

<think> First, let's add 94 and 53 to get 147. Then subtract 63 from 147 to get 84. However, this does not give us 83. Next, let's subtract 63 from 94 to get 31. Now, let's add 53 to 31 to get 84. Again, this doesn't work. Then, let's try subtracting 94 from 53 to get -41. Adding 63 to -41 gives us 22, which is also not equal to 83. Next, let's try subtracting 53 from 94 to get 41. Finally, add 1 to 41 to get 42. This doesn't work either. Now, let's try subtracting 94 from 1 to get -93. Add 53 to -93 to get -40, which is not 83. Then, let's add 94 and 53 to get 147. Subtract 1 from 147 to get 146, and finally subtract 63 to get 83. </think>

<think> First, I'll try adding 45 and 66 to get 111. Then, I'll subtract 84 from 111, which gives me 27. </think>
<answer> (45 + 66) - 84 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's try adding 11 and 49: 11 + 49 = 60. Then, let's subtract 89 from that result: 60 - 89 = -29. Now, let's try adding 11 and 89: 11 + 89 = 100. Then, let's subtract 49 from that result: 100 - 49 = 51. Since neither of these results equals 29, let's try multiplying 11 and 49: 11 * 49 = 539. Finally, let's subtract 89 from that result: 539 - 89 = 450. This result is also not equal to 29. Let's try subtracting 11 from 49: 49 - 11 = 38. Then, let's subtract 89 from that result: 38 - 89 = -51. This result is not equal to 29 either. Now, let's try dividing 49 by 11: 49 / 11 = 4.45. Then, let's add 89 to that result: 4.45 + 89 = 93.45. This result is not equal to 29. Let's try adding 49 and 89: 49 + 89 = 138. Now, let's subtract 11 from that result: 138 - 11 = 127. This result is not equal to 29. </think>
<answer> 89 - 49 - 11 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's try adding 41 and 13: 41 + 13 = 54. Then, let's subtract 88 from 54: 54 - 88 = -34. Now, let's add 33 to -34: -34 + 33 = -1. This doesn't equal 27, so let's try a different combination. Let's add 88 and 33: 88 + 33 = 121. Now, let's subtract 41 from 121: 121 - 41 = 80. Finally, let's subtract 13 from 80: 80 - 13 = 67. This is still not equal to 27. So, let's try a different combination. Let's add 88 and 13: 88 + 13 = 101. Now, let's subtract 41 from 101: 101 - 41 = 60. Finally, let's subtract 33 from 60: 60 - 33 = 27. </think>

<answer> (21 + 45) - 2 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's see if we can add or subtract the numbers. Adding 42 and 45 gives us 87, which is too high. Subtracting 13 from 45 gives us 32, which is still too high. Now let's try subtracting 13 from 42 instead. That gives us 29. Then we can subtract 45 from 29 and get -16, which is close but not quite 16. Since we cannot reach exactly 16 with these operations, let's try another approach. Adding 45 and 13 gives us 58. Then we can subtract 42 from 58 and get 16. </think>
<answer> (45 + 13) - 42 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's try to add 25 and 49. This gives us 74. Then, if we subtract 80 from 74, we get -4. However, this doesn't equal 56. Next, let's try adding 25 and 80. This gives us 105. Then, if we subtract 49 from 105, we get 56. </think>
<answer> (25 + 80) - 49 </answer>

==============
<think> First I'll try to add 25 and 49, which equals 74. Then I'll subtract 80 from 74, which equals 54. That's not the target number 56. Next, let me subtract 25 from 49, which equals 24. Then I'll add 80 to 24, which equals 104. That's too high. Now I'll subtract 49 from 80, which equals 31. Then I'll add 25 to 31, which equals 56. </think>

<answer> (96 + 46) - 63 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's try adding 28 and 77, which equals 105. Then, subtract 98 from 105, which equals 7. Since 7 is not equal to 49, this isn't the correct equation. Now, let's try adding 28 and 98, which equals 126. Then, subtract 77 from 126, which equals 49. This seems like the correct equation. </think>
<answer> (28 + 98) - 77 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's try adding 40 and 91. That gives us 131. Then, we can subtract 61 from 131. This equals 70. </think>
<answer> 40 + 91 - 61 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's look at the options. We can try adding 40 and 91, which gives us 131. Then, subtracting 61 from 131 gives us 70. So, the equation is (40 + 91) - 61. </think>
<answer> (40 + 91) - 61 </answer>

==============
<think> First, we have two options with the numbers 27 and 66. Adding them gives us 93, which is not equal to 13. Subtracting 27 from 66 equals 39, which is also not equal to 13. Next, let's try using 26. 27 - 26 = 1, which is not equal to 13. However, if we try 66 - 26, we get 40, which is not equal to 13 either. Now, let's look at 27 + 26, which gives us 53, not equal to 13. Trying 66 + 26 results in 92, not equal to 13. However, if we add 27 to 26, we get 53, and then subtracting 66 from that gives us 83, which is not equal to 13. Let's try 27 + 26 again, which equals 53. Subtracting 66 from that doesn't give us 13. On the other hand, if we subtract 27 from 26, we get -1, which is not equal to 13. However, if we add the remaining two numbers, 26 and 66, and then subtract 27, we get 66 - 27 + 26 = 66 + 4 = 70, which is not equal to 13. Finally, let's try 66 - (27 + 26). This equals 66 - 53, which is 13. </think>
<answer> 66 - (27 + 26) </answer>

Next, let's try adding 32 and 21 to get 53. Then, let's subtract 38 from 53 to get 15. Finally, let's subtract 61 from 15 to get -46. That also doesn't work. Now, let's try subtracting 32 from 38 to get 6. Then, let's add 21 to 6 to get 27. Finally, let's subtract 61 from 27 to get -34. That still doesn't work. Let's try adding 32 and 61 to get 93.

<think> First, let's add 5 and 23 together. That's 5 + 23 = 28. Then, let's add 86 to 28. So, 28 + 86 = 114. However, this doesn't equal 68. Next, let's try subtracting. If we subtract 5 from 86, we get 86 - 5 = 81. Then, if we subtract 23 from 81, we get 81 - 23 = 58. Still not 68. Let's try adding again, but this time let's add the numbers in a different order. If we add 86 and 23, we get 86 + 23 = 109. Finally, if we subtract 5 from 109, we get 109 - 5 = 104. This is still not 68. Let's try adding 23 and 86 first, then subtract 5: 23 + 86 = 109. Now, subtract 5: 109 - 5 = 104. Still not 68. Let's try a different combination: 86 and 5, then add 23: 86 + 5 = 91. Finally, add 23: 91 + 23 = 114. Not 68. Let's try adding 5 and 86 first, then subtract 23: 5 + 86 = 91. Now, subtract 23: 91 - 23 = 68. </think>

<answer> (69 - 25) - 22 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll add 25 and 69 to get 94. Then, I'll subtract 22 from 94 to get 72. However, this doesn't give me 22. Next, I'll subtract 69 from 25 to get -44. Then, I'll add 22 to -44 to get -22. This is close but not equal to 22. Now, I'll subtract 25 from 69 to get 44. Finally, I'll subtract 22 from 44 to get 22. </think>

<think> First, let's try adding 20 and 46: 20 + 46 = 66. Now, let's subtract 73 from 66: 66 - 73 = -7. This doesn't work. Next, let's try adding 46 and 73: 46 + 73 = 119. Now, let's subtract 20 from 119: 119 - 20 = 99. This also doesn't work. Let's try another combination: (73 - 46) + 20 = 27 + 20 = 47. Now, we're getting closer! The final equation is (73 - 46) + 20. </think>
<answer> (73 - 46) + 20 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll add 37 and 68 to get 105. Then, I'll subtract 4 from 105 to get 101. Since 101 is not equal to 80, I'll try another combination. I'll add 37 and 4 to get 41. Then, I'll subtract 68 from 41 to get -27. This is also not equal to 80. Next, I'll add 68 and 4 to get 72. Finally, I'll subtract 37 from 72 to get 35. Unfortunately, this is not equal to 80 either. Now, I'll try adding 37 and 37 to get 74. Finally, I'll subtract 68 from 74 to get 6. This is not equal to 80. I'll try adding 4 and 68 to get 72. Then, I'll subtract 37 from 72 to get 35. Still not equal to 80. I'll try subtracting 37 from 68 and then adding 4 to get 31. Finally, I'll subtract 37 from 31 again to get -6. This is not equal to 80. One more combination: adding 37 and 4 gives me 41. I'll then subtract 68 from 41 to get -27. This is not equal to 80. Now, I'll try subtracting 68 from 47 to get -25. Finally, I'll add 37 to -25 to get 12. This is not equal to 80. I'll try 68 + 4 = 72, and then subtract 37 to get 35. This is not equal to 80. So far, I have not been able to create an equation equal to 80 using these numbers, but I am going to try one more thing: adding 68 and 37 to get 105. Then I'll subtract 4 twice (105 - 4 - 4 = 97).

Let me try a different combination. I'll add 89 and 19 to get 108. Then, I'll subtract 64 from 108 to get 44. Finally, I'll subtract 41 from 44 to get 3. Still not 35. I'll try one more combination. I'll add 64 and 19 to get 83. Then, I'll subtract 89 from 83 to get -6. Finally, I'll add 41 to -6 to get -6+41=35. </think>

Now, let me try multiplying 4 and 36, which gives me 144. Then I'll subtract 17 from that, which gives me 127. That's still not 49. However, if I subtract 4 from 36, I get 32.

Let's try another combination: add 29 and 82, which gives us 111. Then, subtract 85 from 111, which gives us 26. Finally, subtract 1 from 26, which equals 25. This is not 27 either. Let's try one more combination: add 1 and 85, which gives us 86. Then, subtract 82 from 86, which equals 4. Adding 29 to 4 gives us 33, and we still don't have 27. So, none of these combinations work. </think>

Next, let's try subtracting 23 from 77: that gives us 54, which is still too high. Now, let's subtract 2 from 23: that gives us 21. Finally, we can add 2 to 21: that gives us 23, which is too low.

Finally, subtract 20 from 132, which equals 112. Still not 22. Let's try another combination: subtract 20 from 87, which equals 67. Now, add 45 to 67, which equals 112. We're still not there. Let's try one more: add 20 and 45, which equals 65. Finally, subtract 87 from 65, which equals -22. That's not what we want either. Okay, let's try one more combination: subtract 45 from 87, which equals 42. Add 20 to 42, which equals 62. Subtract 87 from 62, which equals -25. Hmmm, still no luck. Let's try this one: subtract 20 from 45, which equals 25. Add 87 to 25, which equals 112. Oh, this is too close! One last try: subtract 45 from 20, which is not possible since 20 is less than 45. So, we can't use this combination either. We reached the end of trials without finding the correct answer. </think>

However, this also does not equal 12. Let's try one more combination. We can subtract 32 from 32, which equals 0. Then add 14 and 32, which equals 46. Finally, subtract 2, which equals 44.

Finally, add 72 to 44 to get 116. This still doesn't equal 64. Let's try subtracting 10 from 72 to get 62. Then add 16 to 62 to get 78. We can't use 18 since we only have 1 number left for it. Let's try using all the numbers: (72 - 18) + (16 + 10) = 54 + 26 = 80. This is too high. Let's try: (72 - (16 + 10)) + 18 = (72 - 26) + 18 = 46 + 18 = 64. </think>

<think> We need to find a combination using the numbers 4, 66, and 59 that equals 28. First, let's try adding these numbers together: 4 + 66 + 59 = 129, which is too high. Then let's try subtracting them: 66 - 59 = 7, but that is not enough to get 28. Next, let's subtract the largest number first: 66 - 59 = 7, and then add the remaining two numbers: 4 + 7 = 11. Finally, let's add the largest number again: 59 + 11 = 70, which is too high. Let's try adding smaller groups first: 4 + 59 = 63, and then subtract the middle number: 63 - 66 = -3. This is still not 28, so let's try adding 66 and 59 first: 66 + 59 = 125, and then subtract 4: 125 - 4 = 121. This is too high as well. Now let's try subtracting 66 and 59, and then adding 4: ((66 - 59) * 4) = (7 * 4) = 28. </think>
<answer> (66 - 59) * 4 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's try adding 4 and 66: 4 + 66 = 70. Now, subtract 59 from 70: 70 - 59 = 11. That doesn't work. Next, let's try adding 4 and 59 to get 63, and then subtract 66 from it: 63 - 66 = -3. That also doesn't work. Let's try adding 66 and 59: 66 + 59 = 125. Now, subtract 4 from 125: 125 - 4 = 121. That's not the answer we're looking for. However, let's try multiplying 4 and 66: 4 * 66 = 264. Now, subtract 59 from 264: 264 - 59 = 205. That's still not the answer. But, if we add 4 and 59 and then subtract 66: (4 + 59) - 66 = 63 - 66 = -3, that doesn't work either. Finally, let's try multiplying 66 and 59: 66 * 59 = 3894. Now, subtract 4 from 3894: 3894 - 4 = 3890. Clearly, that's not the answer we're looking for. However, what if we try adding 66 and 59 and then subtracting 4: (66 + 59) - 4 = 125 - 4 = 121? Nope, that's not the answer. But, what about adding 4 and 59 and then subtracting 66: (4 + 59) - 66 = 63 - 66 = -3? Hmm, let's try one more time with multiplying 4 and 59 and then subtracting 66: (4 * 59) - 66 = 236 - 66 = 170. Nope, that's not the answer yet. One more attempt: (66 * 4) - 59 = 264 - 59 = 205. Still not the answer. Let's try another approach: (66 - 59) * 4 = 7 * 4 = 28.</think>

Finally, let's add 72 to -46, which gives us 26. This is still not equal to 48. Let's try adding 2 and 72, which gives us 74. Then, subtract 26 from 74 to get 48. </think>

Finally, I'll add 82 to 22, which equals 104. That's still not correct. Let me try adding 76 and 82 first, then subtracting 98, which equals 60. Ah-ha! Now let me add 82 to 60, which equals 142. This doesn't match either. OK, let me take another look. Let me add 98 to 76, which equals 174. Then, I'll subtract 82 from 174, which equals 92. </think>

<think> First, let's add 92 and 33 to get 125. Then, subtract 53 from 125 to get 72. Finally, subtract 92 from 72 to get -10. We can also try adding 92 and 53 to get 145, and then subtract 33 to get 112. Then, subtract 92 to get 20. So, one possible equation is (92 + 53) - 33 - 92 = 0. Another equation could be 92 + (33 - 53) - 92 = 33 - 53 - 92 + 92 = -10. However, another possible equation is 92 + (53 - (33 + 92)) = 92 + (53 - 125) = 92 - 72 - 33 = 20. </think>

Finally, I'll subtract 40 from 53, which equals 13. Still not equal to 93. Now, let me try multiplying 32 by 40, which equals 1280. Subtracting 85 from 1280 equals 1280-85=1195. Not equal to 93. Then, I'll try multiplying 32 by 85, which equals 2680. Subtracting 40 from 2680 equals 2680-40=2640. Still not equal to 93. Let me try adding 40 and 85, which equals 125.

Let's try another combination: Adding 75 and 74 gives us 149, then subtract 25 from 149 gives us 124, and finally adding 74 to 124 still doesn't give us 98. Let's try 75 + 25 = 100, then subtract 74 from 100 = 26, and finally add 74 to 26 = 100, which is not 98. But, if we consider each number can be used only once, let's try 74 + 75 = 149, then subtract 25 from 149 = 124, and add 74 to 25, which gives us 100. But we're allowed to use each number only once. So, let's try 74 + 25 = 99, and then subtract 75 from 99 = 24, and add 74 to 24, which results in 98. </think>

<think> First, let's try to add the two smaller numbers: 28 + 67 = 95. Now, let's subtract 72 from this result: 95 - 72 = 23. This is not 33, so let's try another combination. Let's subtract the smaller number from the larger one: 67 - 28 = 39. Now, let's subtract 72 from this result: 39 - 72 = -33. This is not 33, so let's try one more combination. Let's add 72 to the smaller number: 72 + 28 = 100. Let's subtract the third number from this result: 100 - 67 = 33. </think>

<think>First, we can try to add 46 and 37, which gives us 83. Then, we can subtract 80 from 83, which equals 3. However, this does not result in 71. Next, let's try subtracting 37 from 80, which gives us 43. Finally, we can add 46 to 43, which equals 92. This also does not result in 71. Now, let's try adding 80 and 37, which equals 117. Then, we can subtract 46 from 117, which results in 71. </think>

<think> First, let's try to add 8 and 31 together: 8 + 31 = 39. Then, we can add 80 to 39: 39 + 80 = 119. That's not equal to 57, so let's try a different combination. Let's try subtracting 8 from 80: 80 - 8 = 72. Then, let's subtract 31 from 72: 72 - 31 = 41. That's still not equal to 57, so let's try another combination. Let's try adding 31 to 80: 31 + 80 = 111. Then, let's subtract 8 from 111: 111 - 8 = 103. That's not equal to 57 either. Now, let's try multiplying 8 by 31: 8 * 31 = 248. Finally, let's subtract 80 from 248: 248 - 80 = 168. That's not equal to 57. So, let's try one last combination. Let's try adding 8 to 80: 8 + 80 = 88. Then, let's subtract 31 from 88: 88 - 31 = 57. That's equal to 57! </think>

<answer> (81 + 17) - 72 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's try adding 72 and 17. That gives us 89. Then, we'll subtract 81 from 89. That gives us 8. That's not 26, so let's try another combination. Next, let's add 72 and 81. That gives us 153. Then, subtract 17 from 153. That gives us 136. Not 26 either. Let's try another combination. Let's add 17 and 81, which equals 98. Now, subtract 72 from 98. That gives us 26. </think>

<think> First, let's add 20 and 62 to get 82. Then, add 50 to 82 to get 132. Finally, subtract 55 from 132 to get 77. However, this doesn't equal 87. Next, let's try adding 55 and 50 to get 105. Then, add 62 to 105 to get 167. Finally, subtract 20 from 167 to get 147. This also doesn't equal 87. Let's try another approach: add 62 and 55 to get 117. Then, subtract 50 and 20 from 117 to get 47. Still not 87. Let's try 20 + 62 = 82. Then, add 50 and 55 to 82: 82 + 50 + 55 = 187. Now, subtract 87 from 187: 187 - 87 = 100. This isn't 87 either. But what if we subtract 20 from 50, and then add 55 and 62? 50 - 20 = 30. 30 + 55 + 62 = 147. Finally, subtract 87 from 147 to get the target: 147 - 87 = 60. That's close but not quite there. Let's try 55 - 20 = 35. 35 + 62 + 50 = 147. Now subtract 87: 147 - 87 = 60. Still not 87. However, if we rearrange the operations a bit, let's try: 62 + 55 = 117. 117 - 50 = 67. 67 - 20 = 47. This is still not 87. Lastly, try 20 + 50 = 70. 70 + 55 = 125. 125 - 62 = 63. Far from 87. Last possibility: 20 + 55 = 75. Add 62 to 75, then subtract 50: 75 + 62 - 50 = 87. </think>

Let's try another combination. We can add 84 and 36 to get 120. Then, subtract 72 from 120 to get 48. Finally, subtract 85 from 48 to get -37, which is not correct. Let's try a different combination. Adding 72 and 36 gives us 108. Then, subtracting 84 from 108 gives us 24. Adding 85 to 24 gives us 109, which is too high. We can try adding and subtracting in a different order. Adding 85 and 84 gives us 169. Then, subtracting 72 from 169 gives us 97. Finally, subtracting 36 from 97 gives us 61. </think>

Now, let's try adding 51 and 15, which equals 66. Then, let's subtract 40 from 66, which equals 26. Finally, let's add 71 to 26, which equals 97. This does not equal 75. Let's try another way.

<answer> (71 + 15) - 51 + 40 </answer>

==============
<think>First, I'll start with adding the two largest numbers: 51 + 71 = 122. Then, I'll subtract 15 from the result: 122 - 15 = 107. Finally, I'll subtract 40 from the result: 107 - 40 = 67. However, this doesn't give me 75. Let me try another combination: adding the two smallest numbers, 15 + 40 = 55, then adding the next largest number, 51, equals 106. Finally, subtract the largest number, 71, from 106, which results in 35. This also doesn't give me 75. Let me try one more combination: adding 51 and 40 equals 91, then adding the next largest number, 71, gives me 162. Finally, subtract 15 from 162, which results in 147. This still doesn't give me 75. However, if I change the order slightly, I can get 75 using: 51 + 71 = 122, then subtract the largest number from this result: 122 - 71 = 51. Finally, subtract 40 from 51, which gives me 11. That's not equal to 75 either. Let's try again: 71 + 40 = 111, then subtract 51 from this result: 111 - 51 = 60. Finally, subtract 15 from 60, which gives me 45. This still doesn't give me 75. The only way to get 75 is: 51 + (71 - 15) = 51 + 56 = 107, and 107 - 40 = 67. There must be another way! My last attempt: 51 + 71 = 122, then subtract the sum of the two smallest numbers, 15 + 40 = 55, from 122, resulting in: 122 - 55 = 67. Nope. What else? Let's try: 71 + 40 = 111, subtract 51 from this result, getting 111 - 51 = 60, and subtract 15 from 60, which gives me 45. Not 75. Finally, I found it: 51 + 40 = 91, add the largest number 71, which results in 91 + 71 = 162, and subtract the second largest number 15, which results in 162 - 15 = 147. Ouch. What about: (51 + 71) - (15 + 40) = 122 - 55 = 67. No, that's not 75. Okay, here's one: 51 + 71 = 122, subtract 15 from 122, which results in 122 - 15 = 107, and add 40 to the result, which gives me 107 + 40 = 147. No. Ah-ha! (15 + 40) + (71 - 51) = 55 + 20 = 75! </think>

Next, let's try subtracting 64 from 35, which equals -29. Adding 22 to -29 gives us -17. Finally, adding 93 to -17 results in 76, which is still not 42. Now, let's try subtracting 22 from 35, which equals 13. Adding 64 to 13 gives us 77. This is not 42 either. Let's try adding 35 and 22, which equals 57. Then, subtracting 93 from 57 results in -36. This is not equal to 42. Now, let's try adding 64 and 22, which equals 86. Subtracting 35 from 86 results in 51. This is not 42. Last, let's try subtracting 93 from 35, which equals -58. Adding 64 to -58 results in 6. This is not 42. After trying all these combinations, we find that when we add 35 and 22, then subtract 64, and finally add 93, we get 57 - 64 + 93 = 86. But we need an answer of 42. We can reverse the operations. By adding 35 to 93, we get 128. Then subtracting 64 results in 64. Finally, subtracting 22 from 64 gives 42. So, the correct equation is (35 + 93) - (64 + 22) = 42.</think>

<think> First, let's try to add the largest number, 82, and the smallest number, 7. That gives us 89. Then, let's subtract 12 from 89, which equals 77. </think>
<answer> (82 + 7) - 12 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's try to add the largest numbers together: 88 + 58 = 146. Now we have 146 - 91 = 55. So the equation is (88 + 58) - 91 = 55. </think>
<answer> (88 + 58) - 91 </answer>

<think>First, let's add 15 and 19. That gives us 34. Then, subtract 16 from 34. That gives us 18. So the equation is (15 + 19) - 16 = 18.</think>
<answer> (15 + 19) - 16 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's add 58 and 29 to get 87. Then, we can subtract 66 from 87 to get 21. However, this doesn't give us 95. Let's try another combination: add 66 and 29 to get 95. Now, we need to add 58 to 95 to get 153, which is not what we want. So, let's try another approach: subtract 66 from 58 to get -8. Then, add 29 to -8 to get 21. This still doesn't give us 95. Let's try one more combination: add 58 and 29 to get 87. Then, add 66 to 87 to get 153, which is not what we want. Aha! Wait a minute, let's try subtracting 29 from 58 to get 29. Then, add 66 to 29 to get 95. </think>

<think> First, let's try adding 43 and 30 to get 73. Then, we can subtract 49 from 73 to get 24. Now, let's try adding 49 and 30 to get 79. Then, we can subtract 43 from 79 to get 36. Finally, let's try adding 43 and 49 to get 92. Then, we can subtract 30 to get 62. So, the equation that equals 62 using the numbers [43, 49, 30] is (43 + 49) - 30. </think>

==============
<think> First, let's try to add 83 and 53 to get 136. Then, subtract 1 from 136 to get 135. But that's not equal to 31. Next, let's try adding 83 and 1 to get 84. Then, subtract 53 from 84 to get 31. </think>
<answer> (83 + 1) - 53 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's add 83 and 53, which equals 136. Then, subtract 1 from 136, which equals 135. However, 135 is not equal to 31, so that doesn't work. Let's try another combination. Next, let's subtract 83 from 53, which equals -30. Then, add 1 to -30, which equals -29. Still not equal to 31. Ok, let's try a different combination. Let's add 1 and 53, which equals 54. Then, subtract 83 from 54, which equals -29. That's still not equal to 31. We need to try one more combination. Let's try adding 83 and 1, which equals 84. Then, subtract 53 from 84, which equals 31. This seems to be the correct combination. </think>
<answer> (83 + 1) - 53 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's try to add 55 and 78. That gives us 133. Then, subtract 37 from 133, which equals 96. That doesn't work. Next, let's try subtracting 55 from 78, which equals 23. Finally, subtract 37 from 23, and we get -14, which isn't correct either. Now, let's try adding 55 and 37. That gives us 92. Finally, subtract 78 from 92, and we get 14. </think>

==============
<think> First, add 63 and 85 to get 148. Then, subtract 44 from 148 to get 104. However, this doesn't equal 66. Let's try another approach: add 85 and 44 to get 129, then subtract 63 from 129 to get 66. </think>

==============
<think> First, let's try adding the first two numbers: 10 + 3 = 13. Then, let's add the third number: 13 + 47 = 60. However, this doesn't equal 77. Next, let's try adding the last two numbers: 47 + 3 = 50. Finally, let's add the first number: 50 + 10 = 60. This also doesn't equal 77. Let's try another combination. If we subtract the second number from the first one: 10 - 3 = 7. Then, let's add the third number: 7 + 47 = 54. That's still not 77. Now, let's try multiplying the first two numbers: 10 * 3 = 30. Then, let's subtract the third number: 30 - 47 = -17. It seems like none of these combinations work. However, let's do another combination. If we subtract the third number from the first one: 10 - 47 = -37. Then, let's add the second number: -37 + 3 = -34. No luck here either. Now, let's try adding the third number to the result of multiplying the second number by the first one: 10 * 3 + 47 = 30 + 47 = 77! Now the equation works! </think>
<answer> (10 * 3) + 47 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I will add 37 and 59 to get 96. Then, I will subtract 96 from 1 and the result will be -95, which is not equal to 75. So, I will try another combination. I will add 37 and 96 and get 133. Then, I will subtract 59 from 133 and the result will be 74, which is close but not 75. Next, I will add 59 and 96 and get 155. Then, I will subtract 37 from 155 and the result will be 118, which is not 75. Finally, I will add 96 and 37 and get 133. Then, I will subtract 59 from 133 and the result will be 74, which is not 75. However, if I add 96 and 59 and get 155, I can subtract 37 from 155 and the result will be 118, which is not 75. But if I subtract 37 from 96 and get 59, and then add 59 to 1, the result will be 60. However, I can add 37 and 59 and get 96, and then subtract 1 and add 96 to get 195, which is not 75. </think>

<think> First, let's try adding 18 and 22. This gives us 40. Then, add 43 to 40, resulting in 83. This doesn't equal 47. Next, let's try adding 22 and 43, which gives us 65. Then, subtract 18 from 65, resulting in 47. This works! </think>
<answer> (22 + 43) - 18 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's try adding 18 and 22: 18 + 22 = 40. Then, let's add 43 to 40: 40 + 43 = 83. This doesn't work because we need to get to 47. Now, let's try adding 22 and 43: 22 + 43 = 65. Finally, let's subtract 18 from 65: 65 - 18 = 47. </think>
<answer> (22 + 43) - 18 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's try to add the numbers 18 and 43: 18 + 43 = 61. Then, let's subtract 22 from that result: 61 - 22 = 39. We're still not there. Let's try adding 22 and 43 first: 22 + 43 = 65. Then, let's subtract 18 from that result: 65 - 18 = 47. This gives us the correct answer. </think>
<answer> (22 + 43) - 18 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's try to add the first two numbers: 18 + 22 = 40. Then, let's add the third number to this result: 40 + 43 = 83. This is not equal to 47, so let's try another combination. If we add 22 and 43 first, we get 65. Then, if we add 18 to this result, we get 83, which is not 47. Let's try one more combination. If we add 43 and 18 first, we get 61. Then, if we add 22 to this result, we get 83, which is not 47. Last, let's try the combination where we add 18 and 43 first, and then add 22 to this result: 18 + 43 = 61. Then, 61 + 22 = 83. This is not equal to 47 either. However, if we try subtracting 18 from 43 and then adding 22, we get 43 - 18 = 25. Then, 25 + 22 = 47. This combination gives us the desired result of 47. </think>

==============
<think> First, let's try adding 21 and 25, which equals 46. Then, let's subtract 46 from 42, which gives us -4. Since we can't get 42 with these operations, let's try another combination: adding 25 and 46, which equals 71. Then, let's subtract 21 from 71, which gives us 50. Still not 42. Let's try adding 21 and 46, which equals 67. Then, let's subtract 25 from 67, which gives us 42. This seems to work! </think>

Then, subtract 42 from 130, which equals 88. Still not equal to 34. Now, let's try subtracting 42 from 69, which equals 27. Finally, subtract 61 from 27, which equals -34. This is close, but not equal to 34. Lastly, let's try adding 42 and 61, which equals 103. Finally, subtract 69 from 103, which equals 34. </think>

This is not equal to 58, so let's try another combination. Next, let's add 54 and 55: 54 + 55 = 109. Then, let's subtract the smallest number from this result: 109 - 51 = 58. This gives us the desired result. </think>

<answer> (74 + 89) - 26 - 91 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll try adding 74 and 26, which equals 100. Then, I'll subtract 89 from 100, which equals 11. Finally, I'll subtract 91 from 11, which doesn't work. Next, I'll try subtracting 74 from 91, which equals 17. Then, I'll add 26 to 17, which equals 43. Finally, I'll add 89 to 43, which equals 132. This doesn't work either. Now, let me try adding 74 and 89, which equals 163. Then, I'll subtract 26 from 163, which equals 137. Finally, I'll subtract 91 from 137, which equals 46. This works! </think>

<think> First, let's try to add 20 and 96: 20 + 96 = 116. Then, let's subtract 90 from 116: 116 - 90 = 26. Finally, let's subtract 69 from 26: 26 - 69 = -43. This doesn't give us 95. let's try another combination: let's add 96 and 90: 96 + 90 = 186. Then, let's subtract 20 from 186: 186 - 20 = 166. Finally, let's subtract 69 from 166: 166 - 69 = 97. This is still not correct. Let's try one more combination: let's add 20 and 69: 20 + 69 = 89. Then, let's subtract 90 from 89: 89 - 90 = -1. Finally, let's add 96 to -1: -1 + 96 = 95. </think>

Then adding 45 to -38 results in 7. This is not equal to 83 either. Next, let's try adding 98 and 45, which equals 143. Then subtract 60 from 143, resulting in 83. </think>
<answer> (98 + 45) - 60 </answer>

==============
<think>First, let's try adding 98 and 60: (98 + 60) = 158. Now, we can subtract 45 from it: 158 - 45 = 113. However, this does not equal 83. Next, let's try adding 98 and 45: (98 + 45) = 143. Then, subtract 60 from it: 143 - 60 = 83. This seems correct. </think>

Now, subtract 11 from the result: 139 - 11 = 128. This is still not equal to 20. Let's try another approach: add 11 and 74: 11 + 74 = 85. Now, subtract 65 from the result: 85 - 65 = 20.

==============
<think> First, let's try to add the first three numbers: 92 + 82 + 62 = 236. Then, let's subtract the fourth number: 236 - 43 = 193. That's not equal to 29. Let's try another combination: 92 + 62 + 43 = 197 - 82 = 115 - 43 = 72 - 62 = 11. That's also not equal to 29. Finally, let's try another combination: 92 + 82 - 62 - 43 = 174 - 105 = 69 - 62 = 17 - 43 = -26. That's still not equal to 29. However, if we add the first two numbers and then subtract the third: 92 + 82 - 62 = 174 - 62 = 112 - 43 = 69 - 43 = 26. That's not equal to 29 either. Finally, let's try another combination: 92 + 82 - 43 - 62 = 174 - 105 = 69 - 62 = 17. $$17 - 43 = -26$$ That's still not equal to 29. But wait, if we add the last two numbers and then subtract the first two: 82 + 62 - 92 - 43 = 144 - 135 = 9 - 43 = -34. That's not equal to 29. However, if we add the first and last numbers and subtract the sum of the other two: 92 + 43 - (82 + 62) = 135 - 144 = -9. That's not equal to 29 either. But here's another possibility: 92 + 82 - (62 - 43) = 174 - 19 = 155 - 19 = 136 - 43 = 93 - 43 = 50 - 43 = 7. $$7 + 43 = 50$$ $$50 + 43 = 93$$ $$93 + 62 = 155$$ $$155 + 82 = 237$$ $$237 - 92 = 145$$ $$145 - 82 = 63$$ $$63 + 62 = 125 - 62 = 63 - 43 = 20$$ $$20 + 43 = 63$$ $$63 + 62 = 125$$ $$125 + 82 = 207$$ $$207 - 92 = 115$$ $$115 - 82 = 33$$ $$33 + 62 = 95 - 62 = 33 + 43 = 76$$ $$76 - 62 = 14$$ $$14 + 82 = 96 - 82 = 14$$ </think>

<think> First, let's try adding 56 and 84, which gives us 140. Then, subtract 15 from 140, which gives us 125. However, this does not equal 43. Next, let's try adding 56 and 15, which gives us 71. Finally, subtract 84 from 71, which gives us -13. This is also not 43. Now, let's try subtracting 15 from 84, which gives us 69. Then, subtract 56 from 69, which gives us 13. Finally, add 56 and 13, which gives us 69. However, this is not 43 either. Now, let's try adding 84 and 15, which gives us 99. Then, subtract 56 from 99, which gives us 43.

<think>First, let's try adding 92 and 9. That gives us 101. Then, let's subtract 68 from 101. That would give us 33. So, the equation is 92 + 9 - 68 = 33.</think>

==============
<think> First, I'll try to add 20 and 31: 20 + 31 = 51. Then, I'll subtract 48 from 51: 51 - 48 = 3. Finally, I'll add 83 to 3: 83 + 3 = 86. However, 86 is not equal to 46. Next, I'll try 20 + 48: 20 + 48 = 68. Then, I'll subtract 31 from 68: 68 - 31 = 37. Finally, I'll add 83 to 37: 83 + 37 = 120. This is also not equal to 46. Now, I'll try 20 + 83: 20 + 83 = 103. Subtracting 31 from 103 gives me 72, and then subtracting 48 from 72 results in 24. Therefore, the equation (20 + 83) - (31 + 48) equals 24, and that's not 46 either. But if I create (20 + 48) - (31 + 83), the result is (68 - 114) = -46, which isn't what I'm looking for. Lastly, (48 + 83) - (20 + 31) equals (131 - 51) = 80, still not 46. Now, let me try: (31 + 83) - (20 + 48) equals (114 - 68) = 46. </think>

<think> First, let's try adding the two largest numbers: 75 + 85 = 160. Then, subtract the smallest number: 160 - 43 = 117. This result is not 33, so let's try another approach. Let's subtract the smallest number from the largest one: 75 - 43 = 32. Now, subtract the remaining number: 32 - 85 = -53. This result is still not 33. Let's try adding the smallest number to the average of the other two: (75 + 85) / 2 = 80, and then add 43: 80 + 43 = 123. Finally, subtract the largest number: 123 - 75 = 48. This result is not 33. Let's try another approach. Let's add the two smallest numbers: 75 + 43 = 118. Then, subtract the largest number: 118 - 85 = 33. This result is 33, so the equation is (75 + 43) - 85 = 33. </think>

<answer> (49 + 8) + 9 </answer>

==============
<think>First, I'll try to add 78 and 66 to get 144. Then, I'll subtract 25 from 144 to get 119. However, 119 is not equal to 37. Next, I'll try adding 78 and 25 to get 103. Then, I'll subtract 66 from 103 to get 37. </think>

==============
<think> First, let's try to add 24 and 31: 24 + 31 = 55. Then, let's add 90 to 55: 55 + 90 = 145. That doesn't equal 83. Next, let's try subtracting 90 from 31: 31 - 90 = -59. Then, let's add 24 to -59: -59 + 24 = -35. That also doesn't equal 83. Now, let's try adding 90 and 24: 90 + 24 = 114. Finally, let's subtract 31 from 114: 114 - 31 = 83. </think>
<answer> (90 + 24) - 31 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll add 52 and 4 to get 56. Then, I'll add 67 to the result, getting 123. Finally, I'll subtract 71 from 123 to get 52. However, this doesn't equal 60. Next, I'll try adding 52 and 4 again, but this time, I'll subtract 67 instead of adding it. This gives me 52 - 67 = -15, which is not correct. Now, let's try adding 67 and 4, and then subtracting 52. This gives me 67 + 4 - 52 = 19, still not 60. Next, I'll try adding 67 and 52, and then subtracting 4. This gives me 67 + 52 - 4 = 115, which is far from 60. Finally, let's try subtracting 4 from 67, and then adding 52. This gives me 67 - 4 + 52 = 115, which is also incorrect. However, if I add 52 and 4, and then subtract 71, the result will be 52 - 71 + 4 = 52 - 67 = -5. This is not 60 either. Now, let me try subtracting 4 from 67, and then adding 52. The result is 67 - 4 + 52 = 115, which is still not 60. But if I add 67 and 4, and then subtract 52, I get 67 + 4 - 52 = 19. Finally, if I add 67 and 52, and then subtract 4, the result is 67 + 52 - 4 = 115, but if I subtract 4 from 67 first and then add 52, the result will be 67 - 4 + 52 = 115, but if I add 52 and 4, and then subtract 67, the result is 52 + 4 - 67 = 96 - 67 = 29, still not 60. Now, I've realized that I made an error in my previous calculations. If I add 52 and 4, and then subtract 71, the result is 52 + 4 - 71 = 56 - 71 = -15, which is indeed not 60, but my final equation is incorrect. To get 60, I can add 52 and 4, and then add 71 to the result. This gives me 52 + 4 + 71 = 127 - 67 = 60. </think>
<answer> 52 + 4 + 71 - 67 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's try adding the two smallest numbers: 2 + 3 = 5. Then, we can add 50 to this result: 5 + 50 = 55. However, this doesn't give us the target value of 10. Another approach is to multiply 2 and 3 first: 2 * 3 = 6. Then, subtract 50 from this result: 6 - 50 = -44, which is not the target value either. The correct way to get the target value is to divide 50 by the sum of 2 and 3: (50 / (2 + 3)) = 10. </think>
<answer> 50 / (2 + 3) </answer>

<think> First, let's try to add 54 and 12: 54 + 12 = 66. Next, let's try to add 55 to it: 66 + 55 = 121. Now, let's try to subtract 2 from it: 121 - 2 = 119. However, this doesn't equal 94. Let's try another combination: 54 - 12 = 42, then 55 + 2 = 57, and finally 42 + 57 = 99. Still not equal. Let me try another combination: 54 + 55 = 109, then 12 - 2 = 10, and finally 109 + 10 = 119. And again, this doesn't equal 94. One more combination: (54 / 2) = 27, (12 + 55) = 67, and then 27 + 67 = 94. </think>

This doesn't match our target number. Next, let's try adding 49 and 74 to get 123. Then, let's subtract 1 from 123 to get 122. This still doesn't match our target number. Let's try adding 1 and 74 to get 75. Then, let's subtract 49 from 75 to get 26. This matches our target number! </think>

<think> First, let's try adding 29 and 33. That gives us 62. Then, let's add 85 to 62. That gives us 147. That doesn't look like 89. Next, let's try adding 29 and 85. That gives us 114. Then, let's add 33 to 114. That gives us 147. That still doesn't look like 89. Let's try another combination: let's add 33 and 85. That gives us 118. Then, let's subtract 29 from 118. That gives us 89. </think>

==============
<think> First, let's try adding 48 and 9: 48 + 9 = 57. Then, let's subtract 16 from 57: 57 - 16 = 41. However, 41 is not equal to 23. Now, let's try adding 9 and 16: 9 + 16 = 25. Next, let's subtract 48 from 25: 25 - 48 = -23. No, -23 is not equal to 23 either. Let's try another combination: adding 48 and 16: 48 + 16 = 64. Then, let's subtract 9 from 64: 64 - 9 = 55. This is not equal to 23. However, if we try subtracting 48 from 64 and then subtract 9 from that result: 64 - 48 = 16, and then 16 - 9 = 7, this doesn't equal 23. All other combinations involving 2 numbers have been exhausted, so let's try using all three numbers: 48 - (9 + 16) = 48 - 25 = 23. </think>

==============
<think> First, I notice that 24 + 12 equals 36. Then, if I subtract 24 from 36, I get 12. So, the equation is 24 + 12 - 24, which simplifies to 12. But this doesn't equal 24. Now let me try another combination. I add 12 and 24, which equals 36. Then I subtract 12 from 36, and I get 24. Therefore, the equation is 12 + 24 - 12. </think>

==============
<think> First, let's try adding 38 and 45: 38 + 45 = 83. Then, let's subtract 21 from the result: 83 - 21 = 62. But 62 is not equal to 28. Next, let's try adding 45 and 21: 45 + 21 = 66. Then, subtract 38 from the result: 66 - 38 = 28. </think>

Now, let's try adding 33 and 87 to get 120. Then, we can subtract 25 from 120 to get 95. Finally, we can subtract 7 from 95 to get 88. That's close, but not quite. One more attempt, let's try adding 25 and 7 to get 32. Then, we can add 33 to 32 to get 65. Finally, we can add 87 to 65 to get 152. This one is also not correct.

One more attempt: 87 - 25 = 62. Then, add 33 to 62 to get 95. Finally, subtract 7 from 95 to get 88. This is too high. One more attempt: 87 - 33 = 54. Then, add 7 to 54 to get 61.

Next, let's try adding 21 and 7 and then subtracting 71. This equals 21 + 7 - 71 = -43, which also does not equal 45. Let's try adding 21, 7, and 2 and then subtracting 71. This equals 21 + 7 + 2 - 71 = -41, also not equal to 45. Next, let's try subtracting 21 from 71 and then adding 7 and 2. This equals 71 - 21 + 7 + 2 = 61, still not equal to 45. Now, let's try subtracting 7 from 71 and adding 21 and 2. This equals 71 - 7 + 21 + 2 = 95, also not equal to 45. Finally, let's try adding 71 and 2 and then subtracting 7 and 21.

Now, let's try a different combination: adding 85 and 45 gives us 130. Subtracting 24 from 130 results in 106. Adding 84 to 106 equals 190. Both combinations seem to give us close to 20, but let's try another approach. Multiplying 84 and 45 gives us 3780. Dividing 3780 by 24 equals 158.333, which doesn't seem to work. Let's try one final combination: 24 plus 85 equals 109. Subtracting 84 from 109 gives us 25. Then, subtracting 45 from 25 results in -20. This doesn't give us the desired result. Adding 24 and 85 equals 109. Subtracting 45 from 109 gives us 64. Finally, subtracting 84 from 64 results in -20. This also doesn't work. Oh, I found it! Let's try adding 85 and 45, which gives us 130. Then, let's subtract 84 from 130, which results in 46. At last, subtracting 24 from 46 gives us 22. Oh no, that's not 20. Let me try one more time: 84 plus 45 equals 129. Then, let's subtract 85 from 129, which results in 44. Finally, subtracting 24 from 44 gives us 20. </think>

<think> First, let's add 99 and 32 to get 131. Then, subtract 11 from 131 to get 120. Finally, subtract 14 from 120 to get 106. However, this doesn't equal 70, so let's try another combination. Adding 99 and 32 also gives us 131, but this time let's subtract 14 instead. We get 117. Now, let's subtract 11 from 117. We get 106, which is still not 70. Let's try one last combination: adding 11 and 14, and then subtracting the result from 99. We get 85. Now, let's add 32 to 85. We get 117. Finally, let's subtract 99 from 117. We get 18. It seems none of these combinations worked. Let me recheck my calculations. I think I made an error. Adding 99 and 32 gives us 131, subtracting 11 gives us 120, but subtracting 14 gives us 106. I believe I need to try a different approach. Let's try subtracting 11 from 32 first, then adding 99 to the result and finally subtracting 14. Subtracting 11 from 32 gives us 21. Adding 99 to 21 gives us 120. Finally, subtracting 14 from 120 gives us 106. It's close but still not 70. Let me try one more time. Adding 99 and 14 gives us 113. Then, let's subtract 32. We get 81. Finally, let's subtract 11 from 81. We get 70! </think>

Next, let's try adding 92 and 67, which equals 159. Then we can subtract 27 from 159 to get 132. Finally, we can subtract 73 from 132, which equals 59.

We can try another combination: first, let's subtract 6 from 95, which is 89. Then, let's add 34 to 89, which is 123. Finally, let's subtract 16 from 123, which equals 107. Still not correct. Now, let's try another way: add 6 and 16, which is 22. Then, let's add 95 and 34, which is 129. Finally, let's subtract 22 from 129, which equals 107. This is still not correct. Let's try one more combination: add 6 and 34, which is 40. Then, let's subtract 6 and 16 from 95, which equals 80. Finally, let's add 40 to 80, which equals 120. This is also incorrect. Let's try a different approach: add 6 and 34, which equals 40. Then, let's subtract 95 from 129, which equals 34. Finally, let's subtract 16 from 34, which equals 18. Finally, let's add 40 and 18, which equals 58. This is closer, but still not 83. However, if we add 6 and 16, which equals 22, and then subtract 34 from 95, which equals 61, and finally add 22 to 61, which equals 83, we get the desired result. </think>

Next, let's try adding 85 and 30 to get 115, then subtract 58 to get 57. Finally, subtracting 24 from 57 gives us 33, which is not equal to 81. Now, let's add 58 and 24 to get 82, then subtract 30 to get 52. Subtracting 85 from 52 gives us -33, which is not equal to 81. However, if we try reversing the order of subtraction, we get 58 - 24 = 34, then 34 - 30 = 4. Adding 85 to 4 gives us 89, which is not equal to 81. Finally, let's try adding 24 and 58 to get 82, then subtract 85 to get -3. Finally, adding 30 to -3 gives us 27, which is not equal to 81. However, if we try reversing the order of subtraction, we get 58 - 30 = 28, then subtracting 24 from 28 gives us 4. Adding 85 to 4 gives us 89, which is not equal to 81. But if we add 24 and 30 to get 54, then subtract 58 from 54 gives us -4. Finally, adding 85 to -4 gives us 81. </think>

Then, let's subtract 83 from 42 to get -41. This is not the correct answer either. Let's try one more approach. We can first add 83 and 20 to get 103.

<think> First, let's try to add 47 and 48, which gives us 95. Then, let's subtract 42 from this sum, which will give us 53. But 53 is not equal to 39. Next, let's try adding 47 and 2, which gives us 49. Then, let's subtract 48 from this sum, which will give us 1. This is not equal to 39 either. Now, let's try adding 48 and 2, which gives us 50. Then, let's subtract 47 from this sum, which will give us 3. This is not equal to 39. Finally, let's try adding 2 and 42, which gives us 44. Then, let's subtract 47 from this sum, which will give us -3. This is not equal to 39. However, let's try adding 48 and 42, which gives us 90. Then, let's subtract 47 from this sum, which will give us 43. This is still not equal to 39, but if we subtract 48 from 47, we get -1. Now, let's try adding 47 and -1, which gives us 46. Finally, let's subtract 2 from this sum, which will give us 44. This is not equal to 39. The closest we have come so far is adding 48 and 42, which gives us 90, subtracting 47 gives us 43, and subtracting 2 gives us 41, which is close to 39. However, we can try another combination, adding 48 and 2, which gives us 50. Then, subtracting 47 from this sum gives us 3, and finally subtracting 42 from this will give us -15, which is not equal to 39. But if we add 42 to 47, and subtract 2, we get 87, and subtracting 48 from this will give us 39. </think>

Then, I'll add 27 to 65, which equals 92. Still not 62. Ah, I have another idea - subtract 12 from 27, which equals 15. Then, I'll add 15 to 77, which equals 92. This is still not 62. Finally, let me try adding 77 and 27, which equals 104. Then, I'll subtract 12 from 104, which equals 92. Not 62. Oh, I forgot about the order of operations. Let's try multiplying 77 by 12, which equals 924. Then, let me subtract 27 from 924, which equals 921. Still not 62. One last time, let me try adding 77 and 12, which equals 89. Then, let me add 27 to 89, which equals 116. That's a bit too high. Let me try one more time. Multiplying 27 by 12 gives me 324. Then, subtracting 77 from 324 gives me 247. Still not 62. Last chance - adding 27 and 12 equals 39. Then, adding 77 to 39 equals 116. This is getting close but not quite there. One more attempt. Adding 12 and 27 equals 39. Then, subtracting 77 from 39 equals -38. No success. Let's try subtracting 27 from 77, which equals 50. Then, adding 12 to 50 gives me 62. Success!</think>

<answer> (12 + 92) - 44 </answer>

==============
<think> Start by trying to add and subtract the numbers. 28 + 57 = 85, and 85 - 73 = 12. Alternatively, 73 - 57 = 16, and 16 - 28 = -12. Neither of these equal 12. Now, try multiplying the numbers. 28 * 57 = 1616, and 1616 - 73 = 1543. This doesn't work either. However, 28 * 73 = 2044, and 2044 - 57 = 1987. This still doesn't work. Next, try dividing. 57 / 28 = 2.0357, and 73 - 2.0357 = 70.9643. This doesn't work. Now, let's try 28 - (57 / 73) = 28 - 0.7873 = 27.2127. This doesn't work either. Finally, let's try 73 - (28 / 57) = 73 - 0.4912 = 72.5088. This also doesn't work. However, 57 - (28 / 73) = 57 - 0.3876 = 56.6124. This still doesn't work. Let's try 28 + (57 / 73) = 28 + 0.7873 = 28.7873. This doesn't work. Lastly, let's try (28 * 57) - 73 = 1596 - 73 = 1523. This doesn't work.

I'll add 11 and 51 to get 62. Then, I'll add 15 to 62 to get 77. Finally, I'll subtract 50 from 77 to get 27. Still not equal to 75. Okay, let me try adding 51 and 50 to get 101. Then, I'll subtract 15 from 101 to get 86. Finally, I'll subtract 11 from 86 to get 75. </think>

<think> First, I'll try to add 89 and 72, which is 161. Then I'll subtract 51 from 161, which gives me 110. That's not 34, so I'll try another combination. I'll try subtracting 51 from 89, which is 38. Then I'll add 72 to 38, which is 110. That's not 34 either. Now, I'll try adding 72 and 51, which is 123. Then I'll subtract 89 from 123, which is 34. </think>

==============
<think> First, I will add 87 and 96 to get 183. Then, I will subtract 34 from 183 to get 149. However, 149 is not equal to 25. Next, I will try subtracting 87 from 96 and adding 34, which gives me 41. Still not equal to 25. Then, I will subtract 96 from 87 to get -9, and then add 34, which results in 23. This is still not equal to 25. Now, let me try subtracting 34 from 87 and adding 96, which equals 149. Again, not equal to 25. I will try adding 87 and 34 first, then subtract 96, which gives me 25. This time, I got it right. </think>

<think> First, we can add 70 and 49 to get 119. Then, we can subtract 73 from 119 to get 46. However, this doesn't equal 52. Next, let's try adding 73 to 49 and then subtracting 70. This gives us 20. Finally, we can add 70 to 20 to get 90, which is also not equal to 52. Let's try a different approach: add 73 to 49 and then subtract 70. This gives us 42. Now, let's add 70 to 42, which equals 112. That's still not 52. We should try adding 73 to 70 and then subtracting 49. This gives us 84. Finally, subtracting 49 from 84 yields 35, which isn't 52 either. Let's give up and try adding 70 and 73 first, which equals 143. Then, subtract 49 from 143, which gives us 94. Finally, subtracting 49 from 94 equals 45. That doesn't give us 52. So, it looks like we need to try a different combination. Let's try adding 49 to 73 and then subtract 70. This gives us 52. </think>

==============
<think> First, let's add 70 and 49 to get 119. Then, subtract 73 from 119 to get 46. However, this does not give us 52. Next, let's try subtracting 49 from 70 to get 21. Then, add 73 to 21 to get 94. This also doesn't give us the desired result. Now, let's add 70 and 73 to get 143. Finally, subtract 49 from 143 to get 94, which is still not the answer. I realize I missed a step.

<think> First, I'll add 57 and 21 to get 78. Then, I'll subtract 50 from 78 to get 28. Finally, I'll add 98 to 28, but that doesn't give me the desired result of 30. So, I'll try subtracting 98 from 78 instead, which gives me -20. Subtracting 50 from -20 gives me -70, which is not the answer. Now, let me try adding 50 to the previous result (28) and then subtracting 98: 28 + 50 equals 78, and 78 minus 98 equals -20. That's still not 30. Next, let me try adding 50 to 21 and then subtracting 57: 21 + 50 equals 71, and 71 minus 57 equals 14. That's still not 30. Then, let me try adding 57 to 50 and then subtracting 21: 57 + 50 equals 107, and 107 minus 21 equals 86. That's not the answer either. Finally, let me try adding 21 to 98 and then subtracting 57: 21 + 98 equals 119, and 119 minus 57 equals 62. That's not the result I'm looking for. </think>

Next, I will try subtracting 14 from 59, which gives 45. Then, I will add 58 to 45, which gives 103. This is still not 98. Now, I will try adding 59 and 58, which gives 117. Subtracting 14 from 117 gives 103, still not 98. Next, I will try subtracting 5 from 58, which gives 53. Then, I will add 59 to 53, which gives 112.

However, 35 is not equal to 21. Finally, let's try adding 7 to 23: 7 + 23 = 30. Then, let's subtract 51 from this sum: 30 - 51 = -21. This result is not equal to 21 either. Since none of these combinations worked, let's try another approach. Let's add 7 to 51: 7 + 51 = 58. Then, let's subtract 23 from this sum: 58 - 23 = 35. No, 35 is not equal to 21. Okay, let me try multiplying 7 and 51: 7 * 51 = 357. Then, let's divide 23 by this result: 23 / 357 = 0.064. This is not equal to 21 either.

<think> First, let's try to add 40 and 57: 40 + 57 = 97. Then, let's subtract 72 from 97: 97 - 72 = 25. However, 25 is not the target number, so this combination is not correct. Next, let's try adding 40 and 72: 40 + 72 = 112. Then, let's subtract 57 from 112: 112 - 57 = 55. That's still not the target number. Finally, let's try adding 57 and 72: 57 + 72 = 129. Then, let's subtract 40 from 129: 129 - 40 = 89. This time, we got the target number 89. </think>

==============
<think> First, let's add 55 and 75 to get 130. Then, subtract 58 from 130 to get 72. So the equation is (55 + 75) - 58. </think>
<answer> (55 + 75) - 58 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's add 27 and 28: 27 + 28 = 55. Then, let's add 71 to 55: 55 + 71 = 126. However, 126 is not equal to 71. Next, let's try another combination: 27 + 71 = 98, which is also not equal to 71. Now, let's try 28 + 71 = 99, which is still not equal to 71. However, if we subtract 27 from 71, we get 71 - 27 = 44, which is not equal to 71 either. Finally, let's try adding 71 and 28 again but this time subtract 27: (28 + 71) - 27 = 99 - 27 = 72, which is not equal to 71. But if we try the reverse order, (71 - 27) + 28 = 44 + 28 = 72, which is still not equal to 71. It seems like we missed the correct combination altogether. Let's try another approach: adding 71 and 27 first, and then subtracting 28: (71 + 27) - 28 = 98 - 28 = 70, which is slightly less than 71. Let's reverse the order again: (28 + 27) - 71 = 55 - 71 = -16, which is not equal to 71. Now, let's try multiplying 27 and 28: 27 * 28 = 756, which is much greater than 71. Even if we multiply 71 by 27 or 28, the result would be much larger than 71. So, it seems like 71 cannot be obtained using the given numbers with basic arithmetic operations. However, we can subtract 27 from 28 and multiply the result by 71: (28 - 27) * 71 = 1 * 71 = 71. This gives us the correct answer. </think>
<answer> (28 - 27) * 71 </answer>

I'll add 91 and 49 to get 140. Then, I'll subtract 67 from 140 to get 73. Finally, I'll subtract 39 from 73 to get 34. This still doesn't work. Let me try another combination. I'll add 91 and 39 to get 130. Then, I'll subtract 67 from 130 to get 63. Finally, I'll subtract 49 from 63 to get 14. This works! </think>
<answer> (91 + 39) - (67 + 49) </answer>

==============
<think> 
First, let's try adding 67 and 91 which equals 158.
Then, let's subtract 39 from 158 which equals 119.
Finally, let's subtract 49 from 119 which equals 70.
However, 70 is not equal to 14.
Let's try another combination, adding 91 and 39 which equals 130.
Then, let's subtract 67 from 130 which equals 63.
Lastly, let's subtract 49 from 63 which equals 14.
Therefore, the equation to solve this problem is 91 + 39 - 67 - 49 = 14.

So, let's try a different combination: subtract 73 from 81: 81 - 73 = 8. Add 50 to the result: 8 + 50 = 58. This is not 42 either. Now, let's try one more combination: add 50 to 73: 50 + 73 = 123.

Now, let me try adding 42 and 66 which equals 108. Then, let me subtract 54 from 108 which equals 54. Finally, let me subtract 86 from 54 which equals -32. This is not equal to 76 either. Next, let me try subtracting 54 from 42 which equals -12. Then, let me subtract 86 from -12 which equals -98. This is still not equal to 76. Now, let me try subtracting 86 from 42 which equals -44.

<answer>10 + 14 + 40</answer>

==============
<think> First, let's try adding 16 and 6: 16 + 6 = 22. Now, let's add 30 to that sum: 22 + 30 = 52. However, 52 does not equal 40. Next, let's try subtracting 30 from 16: 16 - 30 = -14. Then, let's add 6 to -14: -14 + 6 = -8. Again, -8 does not equal 40. Now, let's try dividing 16 by 6: 16 / 6 ≈ 2.67. Finally, let's add 30 to that quotient: 2.67 + 30 ≈ 32.67. Still, 32.67 does not equal 40. In summary, none of these combinations worked. However, if we try adding the three numbers directly: 16 + 30 + 6 = 52, which is still not 40. Then, let's try subtracting 6 from 30: 30 - 6 = 24. Finally, let's subtract that result from 16: 16 - 24 = -8. However, -8 is not 40 either. Let's try multiplying 16 by 6: 16 * 6 = 96. Subtract 30 from that result: 96 - 30 = 66. But 66 is not 40. Lastly, let's divide 16 by 30: 16 / 30 ≈ 0.53. Add 6 to that result: 0.53 + 6 = 6.53. This is still not 40. At this point, the most logical solution is to try an addition followed by a subtraction: (16 + 30) - 6 = 36 - 6 = 30. 30 is not 40, but it's one of the closest results we've gotten so far. With only two operations available and each number being used once, it seems like the equation has to be even simpler. Let's try adding 6 to 30: 6 + 30 = 36. Add 16 to that result: 36 + 16 = 52. 52 is not 40, so this option doesn't work. </think>

Next, let's subtract 12 from 42, which equals 30. Then, subtract 1 from 30, which equals 29. Finally, subtract 67 from 29, which equals -38. Still not the desired result. Let's try another combination: add 42 and 67, which equals 109. Then, subtract 12 from 109, which equals 97. Finally, subtract 1 from 97, which equals 96. This is still not the desired result. Let's try one more combination: add 12 and 67, which equals 79. Then, subtract 42 from 79, which equals 37. Finally, subtract 1 from 37, which equals 36. Still not the desired result. The only combination that gives us the desired result of 14 is: add 42 and 12, which equals 54. Then, subtract 1 from 54, which equals 53. Finally, subtract 67 from 53, which equals -14. However, this is not the desired result. Finally, let's try adding 1 and 67, which equals 68. Then, subtract 42 from 68, which equals 26. Finally, subtract 12 from 26, which equals 14. </think>

Let's try another combination: 64 + 24 = 88, then subtract 58: 88 - 58 = 30, and finally subtract 58: 30 - 58 = -28, which is not 28. Let's try a different approach: 64 - 58 = 6, then add 58: 6 + 58 = 64, and finally subtract 24: 64 - 24 = 40, which is still not 28. We need to find a way to reach 28. Let's try another combination: 64 - 58 = 6, and add 24: 6 + 24 = 30, then subtract 58: 30 - 58 = -28, which is not 28.

Finally, let's try adding 17 and 90, which equals 107. Then, subtract 4 from 107, which equals 103. None of these combinations work. Let's try multiplying 4 and 17, which equals 68. Then, add 90 to 68, which equals 158. Now, let's try multiplying 4 and 90, which equals 360. Then, subtract 17 from 360, which equals 343. Finally, let's try adding 17 and 90, which equals 107. Then, add 4 to 107, which equals 111. This is not correct either. It seems like we need to try a different combination. Let's try multiplying 17 and 90, which equals 1530. Then, add 4 and 17, which equals 21. Finally, subtract 21 from 1530, which equals 1509. This is not correct either. Let's try adding 4 and 90, which equals 94.

<think> First, let's try to add 97 and 46. That gives us 143. Then, let's subtract 20 from 143, which gives us 123. However, that doesn't equal 71. Next, let's try adding 46 and 20 to get 66. Then, let's subtract 97 from that, which gives us -31. That's not equal to 71 either. Now, let's add 97 and 20 to get 117. Finally, let's subtract 46 from 117, which gives us 71. </think>
<answer> (97 + 20) - 46 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's try to add 97 and 46. That would give us 97 + 46 = 143. Then, subtracting 20 from 143 would give us 143 - 20 = 123. However, this doesn't equal 71. Next, let's try to add 97 and 20. That would give us 97 + 20 = 117. Then, subtracting 46 from 117 would give us 117 - 46 = 71. So, the equation that equals 71 is (97 + 20) - 46. </think>

<think> First, let's try to use addition and subtraction. We can add 65 and 24 to get 89, which is close to 85. Then, subtract 16 to get 73, which is still a bit off. Now, let's try to add 60 to the previous result: 73 + 60 = 133. This is too high, so let's try another approach. We can multiply 65 by 24 to get 1560. Then, subtract 60 to get 1500, which is also too high. Let's try again by adding 60 and 16 to get 76, and then subtract 24 to get 52. Finally, we can add 65 to get 117, which is too high. Let's try one more time: we can subtract 60 from 65 to get 5, then add 16 and 24 to get 40, and finally add 60 to get 105. This is too high as well.

Now let's try adding 4 to 78 to get 82, then we can subtract 46, which gives us 36. That doesn't work either. There might be another way to combine these numbers. Let's try multiplying 4 by 1, which is 4, then add 78, which gives us 82. Finally, subtract 46 from that result, which equals 36. That's not 35 either.

<think> First, let's try to add 15 and 27. That would give us 42. Then, let's subtract 8 from 42. That would give us 34. This doesn't equal 20, so let's try another combination. Let's try adding 8 and 27 and then subtracting 15. That would give us 27 + 27 - 15 = 42 - 15 = 27. That doesn't work either. Let's try adding 15 and 8, then subtracting 27. That would give us (15 + 8) - 27 = 23 - 27 = -4. That still doesn't work. Let's try multiplying 27 and 8, then subtracting 15. That would give us (27 * 8) - 15 = 216 - 15 = 201. That doesn't equal 20. Let's try multiplying 15 and 8, then subtracting 27. That would give us (15 * 8) - 27 = 120 - 27 = 93. That doesn't work either. Finally, let's try adding 15 and 8, then multiplying the sum by 2. That would give us (15 + 8) * 2 = 23 * 2 = 46. This doesn't equal 20 either. However, let's try adding 27 and 8, then multiplying the sum by 1. That would give us (27 + 8) * 1 = 35 * 1 = 35. This doesn't equal 20. But wait, let's try subtracting 8 and 15 from 27. That would give us 27 - 8 - 15 = 19. This is very close! Let's try adding 2 and 8 to 15. That would give us 15 + 2 + 8 = 25. Wait, this is exactly 20! Oh, I made a mistake. Let's try subtracting 15 from 27, then adding 8. That would give us 27 - 15 + 8 = 12 + 8 = 20. </think>

<think> First, let's try to add 38 and 6, which gives us 44. Then, subtracting 1 from 44 results in 43. Since 43 is not equal to 32, let's try another combination. If we add 38 and 1, we get 39. Subtracting 6 from 39 results in 33, which is still not 32. However, if we try subtracting 38 from 6, we get -32, which is not what we want. Now, let's try multiplying 38 and 1, which results in 38. Subtracting 6 from 38 gives us 32. Therefore, the equation is 38 * 1 - 6 = 32. </think>

<think> First, let's see if adding the numbers gives us 40: 31 + 85 = 116, which is more than 40. Next, let's try subtracting the smallest number from the largest: 85 - 14 = 71. This is still too much. Now, let's try subtracting the largest number and adding the smallest: 85 - 31 + 14 = 68 + 14 = 82, which is still too much. Finally, let's try adding the two smallest numbers and subtracting the largest: 31 + 14 - 85 = 45 - 85 = -40. This is close but not quite there. However, if we flip the operation for the last part, we get 85 - 31 - 14 = 44 - 14 = 30, which is too little. But if we add instead of subtract, we get 85 + 31 - 14 = 116 - 14 = 102, which is too much. Then, let's try another combination: 31 + 85 - 14 = 116 - 14 = 102, which is too much. Ouch, it seems no simple combination works. Let's try something else, like 85 - (31 + 14). Ah, I've found it! </think>

That's not 44. Let's try dividing 70 by 30: 70 / 30 = 2.33333. That's not 44. Let's try dividing 84 by 30: 84 / 30 ≈ 2.8. That's not 44 either. Finally, let's try adding 84 and 70, then subtracting 30: (84 + 70) - 30 = 154 - 30 = 124. That's too high. The correct equation is 84 - (70 - 30) = 84 - 40 = 44. </think>

Next, let's try adding 65 and 63, which is 128, and then subtract 70 from 128, which equals 58. This also doesn't give us 71. Let's try adding 65 and 1, which is 66, and then add 63 to 66, which equals 129. This also doesn't give us 71. Now let's try adding 70 and 63, which is 133, and then subtract 65 from 133, which equals 68. Finally, let's add 1 to 68, which equals 69. That's not 71 either.

<think> First, let's try to add 93 and 78: 93 + 78 = 171. Then, subtract 94 from 171: 171 - 94 = 77. Finally, subtract 15 from 77: 77 - 15 = 62. However, this doesn't equal 64. Let's try another combination: add 94 and 93: 94 + 93 = 187. Then, subtract 78 from 187: 187 - 78 = 109. Finally, subtract 15 from 109: 109 - 15 = 94, which is not 64 either. Let's do one more combination: add 93 and 15: 93 + 15 = 108. Then, subtract 94 from 108: 108 - 94 = 14. Finally, subtract 78 from 14: 14 - 78 = -64. That's not it either. I think I made a mistake somewhere. I'll try one more time: add 94 and 78: 94 + 78 = 172. Then, subtract 93 from 172: 172 - 93 = 79. Finally, subtract 15 from 79: 79 - 15 = 64. This works! </think>

This equals 86. </think>
<answer> (4 + 87) - 5 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll try to add 5 and 4, which equals 9. Then, I'll add 87 to the result, which gives 96. Since 96 is greater than 86, I'll subtract 87 from 96, which equals 9. Then, I'll subtract 9 from 86, which gives 77. However, this doesn't work since we can't use 7 again. Next, I'll try to add 5 and 87, which equals 92. Then, I'll subtract 4 from the result, which gives 88. This also doesn't work. Finally, I'll try to add 4 and 87, which equals 91. Then, I'll subtract 5 from the result, which gives 86. This works! </think>

However, this doesn't equal 77. Next, let's try adding 23 and 55 to get 78. Then, I'll subtract 21 from 78, which gives me 57. Finally, I'll subtract 88 from 57, which results in -31. Still not 77. Let's try adding 21 and 23, which equals 44. Then, I'll add 55 to 44, which gives me 99. Finally, I'll subtract 88 from 99, which results in 11. That's closer but still not 77. Let's try something else. Adding 21 and 55 gives me 76. Then, I'll subtract 88 from 76, which equals -12. That's not 77. Let's try a different approach. Adding 21 and 23 gives me 44. Then, I'll subtract 88 from 55, which results in -33. Still not 77. However, if I add 21 and 88, I get 109. Then, I'll subtract 23 from 109, which gives me 86. Finally, I'll subtract 55 from 86, which results in 31. Oops, that's not 77 either. Oh wait, let me try one last time. Adding 88 and 23 gives me 111. Then, I'll subtract 21 from 111, which equals 90. Finally, I'll subtract 55 from 90, which results in 35. No dice again. Let me switch things up. Adding 88 and 23 gives me 111. Then, I'll subtract 21 from 111, which equals 90. Finally, I'll add 55 to 90, which results in 145. Wait, that's too big. Let's try one more combination. Adding 88 and 21 gives me 109. Then, I'll add 23 to 109, which equals 132. Finally, I'll subtract 55 from 132, which results in 77. </think>

Then, adding 38 to 16, we get 54. Finally, if we subtract 13 from 54, we get 41, which is still not equal to 22. Let's try one last combination. If we add 38 and 3, which equals 41. Then, if we subtract 13 from 41, we get 28, which is still not equal to 22. However, if we add 38 and 13, which equals 51. Then if we subtract 3 from 51, we get 48, which is still not equal to 22.

Now, let's subtract 97 from 25: 25 - 97 = -72. This is the opposite direction we need to go. However, if we add 30 to 97, we get 127. Then, if we subtract 127 from 25, we get 25 - 127 = -102, which is not the desired result. By subtracting 30 from 97, we get 97 - 30 = 67. Finally, adding 25 to 67 gives us 25 + 67 = 92. </think>

<think> We can use subtraction to get 21: (21 - 75) = -54, but this doesn't help us as we need a positive result. Let's try another way: (75 - 18) = 57, which is close but still not 21. Next, let's try (75 - 18) - 15 = 42 - 15 = 27, which is getting closer but not exactly 21. Finally, let's try (75 - 18) - 15 + 18 = 27 - 15 + 18 = 12 + 18 = 30, which is still not 21. Now, let's try (75 - 18) + 15 = 57 + 15 = 72, which is too much. We need something simpler. Let's go back to (21 - 75) but add the 18 at the end: (21 - 75) - 18 = -54 - 18 = -72, this is too negative. Let's try (75 - 18) + 15 = 57 + 15 = 72, but we need 21. Let's switch the order of the operations: (75 - 18) + 15 = 57 + 15 = 72, this is too much. Finally, let's try (21 - 15) + 18 = 6 + 18 = 24, this is too much. But let's try (18 + 15) - 75 = 33 - 75 = -42, this is negative. Let's try (21 + 15) - 75 = 36 - 75 = -39, this is negative. Finally, let's try 21 + (18 - 15) = 21 + 3 = 24, this is too much. Oh, I found it! 21 - (75 -18) = 21 - (75 - 18) = 21 - 57 = -36, this is negative. Let's try (21 - (18 - 75)) = (21 - (-57)) = 21 + 57 = 78, this is too much. Finally, let's try (18 + 15) - 21 = 33 - 21 = 12, this is not 21. Hmm, I think I got it! (75 - 18) + (21 - 15) = 57 + (21 - 15) = 57 + 6 = 63, this is too much. One more try: (75 - 18) - (21 - 15) = 57 - (21 - 15) = 57 - 21 + 15 = 36 + 15 = 51, this is too much. Let's try (75 - 18) - (21 + 15) = 57 - (21 + 15) = 57 - 36 = 21. </think>

Let's try another combination: add 85 and 15 to get 100. Then, add 49 to 100 to get 149. Now, let's subtract 38 from 149 to get 111. This is also not equal to 89. Try adding 85 and 49 to get 134. Then, add 38 to 134 to get 172. Finally, subtract 15 from 172 to get 157. Still not equal to 89. Let's try one more combination: add 15 and 49 to get 64. Then, add 85 to 64 to get 149. Finally, subtract 38 from 149 to get 111. That's still not 89. Let's try another approach: add 38 and 49 to get 87. Then, add 85 to 87 to get 172. Finally, subtract 15 from 172 to get 157. Nope. It seems none of these combinations work. Let me recheck one more time: add 38 and 49 to get 87. Then, add 85 to 87 to get 172. Finally, subtract 15 from 172 to get 157. Nope. I think I made an error somewhere. Try adding 85 and 49 to get 134. Then, subtract 85 from 134 to get 49, not 89. Add 38 and 15 to get 53. Finally, add 49 to 53 to get 102, still not 89. Ah, let's try another: add 85 and 15 to get 100. Then, subtract 85 from 100 to get 15, and add 38 to get 53, and finally 49 to get 102, not 89.

Finally, I'll multiply 10 by 3 to get 30, and then subtract 63 to get -33, which is not 11 either. But wait, if I take 10 and subtract 63, I get -53, which is not 11 either. However, if I try a different combination, I'll add 10 and 3 to get 13, then subtract 63 which is -50, but if I add 63 to 3, I get 66, and then subtract 10 which is 56, which is not 11.

<think> First, let's try adding 97 and 57: 97 + 57 = 154. This is too high. Next, let's try adding 57 and 1: 57 + 1 = 58. This is still too high. Then, let's try adding 97 and 1: 97 + 1 = 98. This is still too high. Next, let's try subtracting 1 from 57: 57 - 1 = 56. This is closer but still not right. Finally, let's try subtracting 97 from 57: 57 - 97 = -40. This is too low. Oh wait! Let's add 97 and 1, and then subtract 57: (97 + 1) - 57 = 41 - 57 = -16. That's too low. But if we subtract 97 from 57 first, and then add 1: (57 - 97) + 1 = -40 + 1 = -39. That's also too low. Let's try subtracting 57 from 97, and then adding 1: (97 - 57) + 1 = 40 + 1 = 41. That's too high. One more time: (97 - 1) - 57 = 96 - 57 = 39. That's it! The equation that equals 39 is (97 - 1) - 57. </think>
<answer> (97 - 1) - 57 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's try to add 65 and 39 which equals 104. Then, subtract 56 from 104 which leaves us with 48. Finally, subtract 58 from 48 which equals -10. This doesn't equal 10, so let's try another combination. Adding 65 and 56 gives us 121, then subtracting 39 from 121 equals 82, and finally subtracting 58 from 82 equals 24. This also doesn't equal 10. Let's try adding 56 and 39 which equals 95, then subtracting 65 from 95 gives us 30, and subtracting 58 from 30 equals -28. This still doesn't equal 10. Now let's try multiplying 65 by 39 which equals 2535, then subtracting 56 from 2535 gives us 2529, and finally subtracting 58 from 2529 equals 2471. This doesn't equal 10 either. Let's try adding 65 and 58 which equals 123, then subtracting 56 from 123 gives us 67, and finally subtracting 39 from 67 equals 28. This doesn't equal 10. Let's try adding 56 and 58 which equals 114, then subtracting 65 from 114 gives us 49, and finally subtracting 39 from 49 equals 10. This equals 10! </think>
<answer> (56 + 58) - (65 + 39) </answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll add 69 and 19 to get 88. Then, I'll add 4 to 88 to get 92. However, 92 is not equal to 46. Next, I'll subtract 4 from 69 to get 65. Then, I'll add 19 to 65 to get 84. Still not 46. Now, I'll subtract 19 from 69 to get 50. Finally, I'll add 4 to 50 to get 54. This is not the solution either. But, I'll try a different approach. I'll multiply 69 by 4 to get 276. Then, I'll subtract 19 from 276 to get 257. After that, I'll subtract 4 from 257 to get 253. Unfortunately, this doesn't give me 46. Now, I'll divide 69 by 4 (which equals 17.25) and add 19 to get 36.25. This is also not the solution. Let me try another method. I'll subtract 4 from 69 to get 65. Then, I'll subtract 19 from 65 to get 46. That's exactly what I needed! </think>

<think> First, let's try adding 29 and 48. That gives us 77. Then, let's subtract 3. That gives us 74. Finally, let's add 49. That gives us 123. But we want to get 71, so let's try subtracting 48 from 49. That gives us 1. Then, let's add 3 and 29. That gives us 32. Finally, let's subtract 1. That gives us 31. That's not 71, so let's try another combination. Let's add 49 to 48. That gives us 97. Then, let's subtract 29 and 3. That gives us 65. That's not 71 either. Let's try multiplying 29 and 48. That gives us 1392. Then, let's subtract 49 and 3. That gives us 1340. That's not 71 either. Let's try dividing 49 by 3. That gives us approximately 16.33. Then, let's add 29 and 48. That gives us 77. Finally, let's subtract 16.33. That gives us 60.67. That's still not 71. Let's try adding 49 and 3. That gives us 52. Then, let's add 29 and 48. That gives us 77. Finally, let's subtract 52. That gives us 25. Still not 71. Let's try adding 49 to 48. That gives us 97. Then, let's subtract 29. That gives us 68. Finally, let's add 3. That gives us 71. </think>

Then, I'll add 45 to 8. That equals 53. That still doesn't equal 37. Now, I'll try adding 27 and 45. That equals 72. Then, I'll subtract 35 from 72. That equals 37. </think>
<answer> (27 + 45) - 35 </answer>

==============
<think> Start by adding 35 and 45 together to get 80. Then subtract 27 from 80 to get 53. However, this doesn't equal 37. Now try adding the numbers in a different order: add 45 and 27 to get 72, then subtract 35 from 72 to get 37. </think>

<think> First, let's add 39 and 39 to get 78. Then, subtract 13 from 78 to get 65. Since 65 is not equal to 13, let's try another combination. Let's subtract 39 from 39 to get 0. Then, add 13 to 0 to get 13. </think>
<answer> 39 - 39 + 13 </answer>

==============
<think>First, let's add 39 + 39, which equals 78. Now, let's subtract 13 from 78, which equals 65. However, this doesn't equal 13. Let's try another approach - let's add 39 + 13, which equals 52. Then, let's subtract 39 from 52, which equals 13. </think>

==============
<think> First, let's add 43 and 38 together, which gives us 81. Then, let's subtract 87 from 81, which gives us -6. However, that doesn't equal 92. Now, let's try another approach: let's add 87 and 38, which equals 125. Then, we subtract 43 from 125, which equals 82. Still not 92, but closer. Finally, let's try adding 87 and 43, which gives us 130. Then, subtract 38 from 130, which equals 92. </think>
<answer> 87 + 43 - 38 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll try to add 39 and 4, which gives me 43. Then I'll add 89 to 43, which results in 132. However, this doesn't equal 67. Next, I'll try to subtract 4 from 39, which equals 35. Then I'll add 89 to 35, resulting in 124. Still not equal to 67. Now, I'll try to subtract 89 from 39, which gives me -50. Then I'll add 4 to -50, resulting in -46. That's still not 67. Finally, I'll try to add 39 and 89, which equals 128. Then I'll subtract 4 from 128, resulting in 124. This is still not 67. It seems like I've tried every combination of addition and subtraction, and none of them equal 67. I should try using multiplication or division. Let me try dividing 39 by 4, which equals 9.75. Then I'll add 89 to 9.75, and that gives me 108.75. This is not equal to 67 either. Let me try multiplying 39 by 4, which equals 156. Then I'll subtract 89 from 156, resulting in 67. This equals 67!</think>

<think> First, let's try to add 1 and 81, which gives us 82. Then, subtract 58 from 82, which results in 24. However, this doesn't equal 22. Next, let's try adding 1 and 58, which gives us 59. Then, subtract 81 from 59, which results in -22. This also doesn't equal 22. Now, let's try adding 81 and 58, which gives us 139. Finally, subtract 1 from 139, which results in 138. This doesn't equal 22 either. But, if we try adding 81 and 1, which gives us 82, and then subtract 58 from 82, we get 24. Adding another 1 to 24 doesn't help. Let's try dividing 81 by 58, which gives us approximately 1.40, and adding 1, resulting in 2.40. Continuing with this process, dividing 58 by 1, which is 58, and adding 81, results in 139. Adding 1 to 139 doesn't help. Let's try the equation 81 + 58 - 1 = 138. This is still not equal to 22. Now, let's try 58 - (1 + 81) = -24. This still doesn't equal 22. Finally, let's try 81 + 1 - 58 = 24. This is still not equal to 22. However, if we try 1 + 81 + 58, we get 140. Subtracting 140 from 140 with a negative sign, which is -140, doesn't help. Let's try 81 - 1 - 58, which results in 22. </think>

Now let's try another combination: first, let's add 11 and 69, which equals 80. Then, let's add 15 to 80, which equals 95. Finally, let's subtract 15 from 95, which equals 80. Still not 73. Let's try one more combination: first, let's add 15 and 69, which equals 84. Then, let's subtract 11 from 84, which equals 73. </think>

<think> First, let's try to add 47 and 96 which equals 143. Then, subtract 17 from 143 which gives us 126. Finally, subtract 53 from 126 which equals 73. However, this does not give us 85. Instead, let's try subtracting 47 from 96 which equals 49. Then, add 17 and 53 which equals 70. Finally, subtract 70 from 49 which does not give us 85. Let's try another approach. Add 96 and 17 which equals 113. Then, subtract 53 from 113 which equals 60. Finally, add 47 to 60 which equals 107. This is also not 85. Let's try one more approach. Subtract 47 from 96 which equals 49. Then, subtract 17 from 49 which equals 32. Finally, subtract 53 from 32 which does not give us 85. I think I found the correct approach. Add 17 and 53 which equals 70. Then, subtract 47 from 70 which equals 23. Finally, subtract 96 from 23 which does not give us 85. Let's try one more approach. Add 47 and 53 which equals 100. Then, subtract 96 from 100 which equals 4. Finally, add 17 to 4 which equals 21. This is also not 85. However, I noticed that I made an error in my previous thought process. Let's try subtracting 53 from 96 which equals 43. Then, add 47 to 43 which equals 90. Finally, subtract 17 from 90 which equals 73. This is not 85 either. But I found another approach. Add 47 and 17 which equals 64. Then, subtract 53 from 64 which equals 11. Finally, add 96 to 11 which equals 107. This is also not 85. Let's try one more approach. Add 96 and 53 which equals 149. Then, subtract 47 from 149 which equals 102. Finally, subtract 17 from 102 which equals 85. </think>
<answer> (96 + 53) - 47 - 17 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's add 47 and 53: 47 + 53 = 100. Then, subtract 96 from the result: 100 - 96 = 4. Lastly, add 17 to the result: 4 + 17 = 21. However, 21 is not equal to 85. Now, let's try another combination: Add 96 and 53: 96 + 53 = 149. Then, subtract 47 from the result: 149 - 47 = 102. Finally, subtract 17 from the result: 102 - 17 = 85. This gives us the equation: 96 + 53 - 47 - 17 = 85. </think>

I'll add 44 and 23 to get 67. Then, I'll subtract 89 from 67 to get -22. Now, I'll add 89 and 75 to get 164. Lastly, I'll subtract 67 from 164 to get 97. This is still not the correct answer. Now, I'll try another combination. I'll add 44 and 89 to get 133. Then, I'll subtract 75 from 133 to get 58. Finally, I'll add 23 to 58 to get 81. </think>

Then, we can add 2 again, giving us 30. Still not 54. Now, let's try subtracting 2 from 26, which equals 24. Then, we can add 2, resulting in 26. That's closer, but not 54 yet. Finally, let's try adding 26 and 2, which again equals 28. Then, we can add 2 one more time, giving us 30. No, that doesn't equal 54. Let's try a different approach; let's multiply 26 by 2, which equals 52. Then, we can add 2 to the result, finally getting 54. </think>

<think> First, let's try adding 11 + 46 to get 57. Then, we can add another 11 to get 68. However, this doesn't equal 75. Let's try subtracting 11 from 46, which gives us 35. Then, adding 11 to 35 results in 46, which doesn't equal 75 either. Let's add 11 to 46 first, getting 57. Finally, let's subtract 11 from 57, resulting in 46. This doesn't equal 75 either. Now let's try another approach: adding 11 to 46 gets 57. Then, let's subtract 11 from 57, which results in 46. Finally, if we add the remaining 11 to 46, we get 57 + 11 = 68, which is still not equal to 75. At last, let's try adding 46 to 11, getting 57. Then, subtract 11 from 57, resulting in 46. Adding the last 11 to 46 gives us the final sum of 67. However, if we add 46 to 11, get 57. Then, add 11 to 57, the result is 68. That's still not 75. Let's try multiplying 11 by 11, getting 121.

<think>First, I will add 67 and 17 to get 84. Then I subtract 44 from 84 to get 40. Finally, I subtract 5 from 40 to get 35. However, this doesn't equal 11. Next, I will try adding 67 and 44 to get 111. Then I subtract 17 from 111 to get 94. Finally, I subtract 5 from 94 to get 89. This still doesn't equal 11. Then I will try adding 17 and 44 to get 61. Then I subtract 67 from 61 to get -6. Finally, I subtract 5 from -6 to get -11. This gets me one step closer, but not there yet. Next, I will try adding 67 and 44 and multiplying the result by 2 to get 260. Then I subtract 17 from 260 to get 243. Finally, I subtract 5 from 243 to get 238. This is still not 11. Then I will try adding 17 and 5 to get 22. Then I multiply the result by 67 and then subtract 44 to get 1546. Finally, I subtract 22 from 1546 to get 1524. This is still not 11. Next, I will try subtracting 67 from 44 to get -23. Then I add 5 to -23 to get -18. Finally, I add 17 to -18 to get -1. This isn't 11, but it is closer. Next, I will try adding 67 and 5 to get 72. Then I subtract 17 from 72 to get 55. Finally, I subtract 44 from 55 to get 11. This equals 11! </think>

==============
<think> First, let's try adding 57 and 99 to get 156. Then, we can subtract 88 from 156 to get 68. However, this does not equal 46. Let's try another approach. We can add 57 and 88 to get 145, and then subtract 99 from 145 to get 46. </think>
<answer> (57 + 88) - 99 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's add 26 and 28 to get 54. Then, let's subtract 54 by 92 to get -38. Since we need a positive result, we can also try adding 92 to 26 and 28, which equals 146. Now, let's subtract 146 by 38, which gives us 108. Finally, let's subtract 146 by 92, which equals 54. Now let's add 26 and 28, which gives us 54 again. Subtracting 54 by 38 still gives us -38. Lastly, let's try multiplying 26 by 28 to get 728. Adding 92 to 728 results in 800. Finally, subtracting 800 by 38 gives us 762. None of these seem to be 38, but let's try another approach. Adding 26 and 92 equals 118. Subtracting 118 by 28 equals 90, and adding 28 to 90 gives us 118. Subtracting 118 by 92 gives us -26. Adding 26 to -38 doesn't work, so let's try again. Multiplying 26 by 28 gives 728. Adding 92 to 728 gives 800, which isn't 38 either. However, if we subtract 92 from 800 we get 708, and then subtracting 708 by 26 results in 682. Subtracting another 26 from 682 equals 656, then subtracting 656 by 28 we get 628, which is not 38. Now let's subtract 26 by 28 and add the result to 92, which gives us 62. Finally, let's subtract 62 by 28, and we get 34. This isn't 38, though. Lastly, try subtracting 28 by 26, which equals 2. Now, add 92 to 2, which results in 94. Subtracting 94 by 38 gives us 56. None of these calculations have resulted in 38, but I'll try one more time. Adding 26 and 28 gives 54. Multiplying 54 by 38 equals 2052, which isn't the expected 38. However, if we subtract 54 from 2052, we get 1998, which is not 38. Lastly, try subtracting 26 from 92, which equals 66. Then, subtract 66 by 28, yielding 38. </think>
<answer> (92 - 26) - 28 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's try adding 26 and 28: 26 + 28 = 54. Then, let's subtract 92 from 54: 54 - 92 = -38. However, this does not equal 38. Next, let's try adding 26 and 92: 26 + 92 = 118. Then, let's subtract 28 from 118: 118 - 28 = 90. This does not equal 38 either. Now, let's try subtracting 28 from 92: 92 - 28 = 64. Then, let's subtract 26 from 64: 64 - 26 = 38. This equals 38. </think>
<answer> (92 - 28) - 26 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's try adding 88 and 47: 88 + 47 = 135. Now let's subtract 58 from 135: 135 - 58 = 77. This is close to 17, but not quite there. Next, let's try subtracting 88 from 47: 47 - 88 = -41, which is not possible since we need a positive result. So, let's try subtracting 58 from 88: 88 - 58 = 30. Now let's subtract 47 from 30: 30 - 47 = -17, which is not our target. Finally, let's try dividing 88 by 47 and then adding 58: 88 / 47 + 58 ≈ 2.891 + 58 ≈ 60.891. None of these options seem to work. However, if we reverse the order of the numbers, we get 58 + 47 = 105, and then subtract 88: 105 - 88 = 17. </think>

<think> First, let's try adding the two smaller numbers: 22 + 2 = 24. Then, let's add the result to the largest number: 36 + 24 = 60. However, 60 is not equal to 56. Next, let's try subtracting the smallest number from the sum of the other two: (36 + 22) - 2 = 56. This equals 56, so the equation is 36 + 22 - 2 = 56. </think>

<think> First, I'll add 29 and 77 to get 106. Then, I'll subtract 10 from 106 to get 96. However, this does not equal 58. Let me try subtracting 77 from 106 to get 29, and then adding 29 and 10. This gives me 39, which is still not 58. Next, let me try subtracting 10 from 77 and then adding that result to 29. This equals 87 - 10 = 77, and then 77 + 29 = 106, which is too high. Finally, let me try subtracting 29 from 77 and then adding 10. This gives me 48, and then adding 10 results in 58. </think>

Next, let's try adding 86 and 6, which equals 92. Then, let's subtract 70 from 92, which gives us 22. Finally, let's add 44 to 22, and we get 66. </think>

That gives me 91. Then, I will subtract 81 from that result. However, 91 - 81 = 10. So, the correct equation is (98 - 81) - 7 = 10. </think>

==============
<think> First, let's try to add 66 and 37. That gives us 103. Then, let's subtract 47 from that sum. 103 - 47 equals 56. Now, let's add 9 to that result. 56 + 9 equals 65. However, we want the final result to be 85, so let's try another combination. Let's add 66 and 47. That gives us 113. Then, let's subtract 9 from that sum. 113 - 9 equals 104. Finally, let's subtract 37 from that result. 104 - 37 equals 67. None of these results are 85, so let's try one more combination. Let's add 9 and 37. That gives us 46. Then, let's add 66 to that sum. 66 + 46 equals 112. Finally, let's subtract 47 from that result. 112 - 47 equals 65. Still no luck. Let's try a different combination. Let's add 9 and 66. That gives us 75. Then, let's add 47 to that sum. 75 + 47 equals 122. Finally, let's subtract 37 from that result. 122 - 37 equals 85. </think>

<think> First, let's try to add 85 and 49 to get 134. Then, subtract 76 from 134 to get 58. This doesn't equal 40. Next, let's try adding 85 and 76 to get 161. Then, subtract 49 from 161 to get 112. This is still not 40. Now, let's try subtracting 49 from 85 to get 36. Finally, subtract 76 from 36 to get -40. This doesn't equal 40 either. Let's try adding 49 and 76 to get 125.

I'll subtract 19 from 67, which equals 48. Finally, I'll subtract 16 from 48, which equals 32. This doesn't equal 70 either. Let me try one more combination. I'll add 16 and 19, which equals 35. Then, I'll subtract 67 from 35, which equals -32. This is close but not equal to 70. Finally, I'll add 67 and 19, which equals 86. Then, I'll subtract 16 from 86, which equals 70. </think>

==============
<think>First, let's try to add 72 and 43: 72 + 43 = 115. Then, let's subtract 84 from 115: 115 - 84 = 31. So, the equation that equals 31 is 72 + 43 - 84. </think>

==============
<think> First, we can add 25 and 24 to get 49. Then, we add 67 to 49 to get 116. However, this does not equal 66. Next, let's try subtracting 25 from 67, which gives us 42. Finally, we subtract 24 from 42, resulting in 18. This is still not equal to 66. Let's try another approach: adding 67 to 25 gives us 92. Then, we subtract 24 from 92, which equals 68. This is close but not exactly 66. Another option is to subtract 24 from 67 first, which gives us 43. Then, adding 25 to 43 results in 68. Also, we can try adding 25 and 24 to get 49, and then subtracting 67 from 49, but this equals -18, which is not equal to 66. However, if we add 24 and 25, we get 49. Then, subtracting 67 from 49 gives us -18, which is not correct either. After considering various combinations, adding 25 and 67 gives us 92, and then subtracting 24 from 92 equals 68. Although not equal to 66, subtracting 1 from 68 is equal to 67, and adding 25 to 67 equals 92, which is close. Adding 24 and 67 first gets us 91, and then subtracting 25 from 91 gives us 66. </think>

<think> First, let's try to add 95 and 50 to get 145. Then, subtract 23 from 145 to get 122. However, this doesn't equal 22. Next, let's try adding 95 and 23 to get 118. Finally, subtract 50 from 118 to get 68. This is still not equal to 22. Now, let's try adding 50 and 23 to get 73. Subtract 95 from 73 to get -22. Finally, let's try adding 23 and 50 to get 73. Subtract 95 from 73 to get -22. Let's try a different combination: 95 minus 50 is 45. Adding 23 to 45 gives us 68. Subtracting 22 from 68 results in 46. Again, this doesn't work. However, if we recalculate, 95 minus 50 is 45. Adding 23 to 45 is still 68. Subtracting 22 from 68 still gives us 46. This isn't correct either. But then I notice something: if we take 95 minus 23, we get 72. Now, subtract 50 from 72, and we get 22. </think>

Finally, let's try 70 + (99 - 51) = 70 + 48 = 118. However, none of these meet the requirement of equaling 80. Let's try another approach: 99 - 51 = 48, and then add 70: 48 + 70 = 118. This also doesn't work. Now, let's try 99 - 70 = 29, and then add 51: 29 + 51 = 80. This seems to be the correct answer. </think>

Then, we can subtract 65 from 94 to get 29. Still not equal to 23. Let's try another combination: adding 65 and 3 gives us 68. Then subtracting 91 from 68 gives us -23, which is not correct. Finally, let's try adding 91 to 65, which gives us 156. Then, subtracting 3 from 156 gives us 153. We need to adjust this further. Let's subtract 65 from 91, which gives us 26. Then, subtracting 3 from 26 gives us 23. </think>
<answer> (91 - 65) - 3 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's see if we can add some numbers together to get closer to 86. We can start by adding 52 and 75, which gives us 127. Then, we can subtract 93 from 127, which gives us 34. Finally, we can add 30 to 34, which gives us 64. However, we need an equation that equals 86, so let's try a different approach. We can start by subtracting 30 from 93, which gives us 63. Then, we can add 52 to 63, which gives us 115. Finally, we can subtract 75 from 115, which gives us 38. We still haven't reached 86, so let's try one more approach. We can start by adding 93 and 30, which gives us 123. Then, we can subtract 75 from 123, which gives us 48. Finally, we can add 52 to 48, which gives us 100. However, this is too high. Let's try a different combination. We can start by subtracting 30 from 75, which gives us 45. Then, we can add 52 to 45, which gives us 97. Finally, we can subtract 93 from 97, which gives us 4. This is too low, but let's try a different approach. We can start by adding 52 and 93, which gives us 145. Then, we can subtract 75 from 145, which gives us 70. Finally, we can subtract 30 from 70, which gives us 40. That's a far cry from 86, so let's try one more approach. We can start by adding 75 and 93, which gives us 168. Then, we can subtract 52 from 168, which gives us 116. Finally, we can subtract 30 from 116, which gives us 86! </think>

<think> First, I'll add 80 and 21 to get 101. Then, I'll subtract 16 from 101 to get 85. This is not equal to 43. Next, I'll try adding 21 and 16, which gives me 37. Then I'll subtract 80 from 37, which gives me -43. That's not it either. Now, let me try subtracting 21 from 80, which gives me 59. Then subtracting 16 from 59 yields 43. </think>

<think> First, we can add 7 and 77 to get 84. Then, we can subtract 23 from 84 to get 61. However, this isn't equal to 47. Next, let's try adding 7 and 23 to get 30, then adding that to 77 to get 107. This is still not equal to 47. Now, let's subtract 77 from 7 to get -60, and then add 23 to get -37. Again, this isn't equal to 47. Finally, let's try adding 77 and 23 to get 100, and then subtracting 7 to get 93. This is not equal to 47. Seems like none of these attempts worked. Let's try another approach. We can add 7 to 77 to get 84, and then subtract 23 from the result to get 61. This is still not equal to 47. Let's try dividing 77 by 7 to get 11, then adding 23 to get 34. This is still not equal to 47. Let's try subtracting 7 from 77 to get 70, and then adding 23 to get 93. This is not equal to 47. But wait, let's try subtracting 23 from 77 to get 54, and then subtracting 7 from the result to get 47. Ah-ha! We found it! </think>

==============
<think> First, let's try adding 45 and 55. That equals 100. Then, let's subtract 64 from 100. That equals 36. However, 36 is not equal to 54. Next, let's try subtracting 45 from 55. That equals 10. Then, let's add 64 to 10. That equals 74. Still not 54. Now, let's try subtracting 55 from 64. That equals 9. Then, let's add 45 to 9. That equals 54. </think>
<answer> 64-55+45 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's try adding 45 and 55, which equals 100. Then, subtract 64 from 100, which equals 36. That's not right because we want 54. Next, let's try adding 64 and 55, which equals 119. Then, subtract 45 from 119, which equals 74. That's not right either. Now, let's try subtracting 45 from 64, which equals 19. Then, add 55 to 19, which equals 74. That's not 54. Finally, let's try subtracting 55 from 64, which equals 9. Then, add 45 to 9, which equals 54. This seems correct! </think>

==============
<think> First, let's try adding 27 and 61, which gives us 88. Then, let's add 64 to 88, which gives us 152. That's not equal to 98, so let's try another combination. Next, let's try adding 61 and 64, which gives us 125. Then, let's subtract 27 from 125, which gives us 98. This looks like the correct combination. </think>

==============
<think> First, I'll try to add 72 and 10 to get 82. Then, I'll subtract 73 from 82 to get 9, and finally, I'll add 23 to 9 to get 32. However, this doesn't give me the desired result. Next, I'll try adding 72 and 73 to get 145, and then subtract 10 from 145 to get 135. This is still not the desired result. I'll now try adding 23 and 10 to get 33, and then subtract 72 from 33 to get -39. This is also not the desired result. Finally, I'll try adding 73 and 23 to get 96, and then subtract 10 from 96 to get 86. This still doesn't give me the desired result. However, I'll try another approach, where I'll subtract 23 from 72 to get 49, and then add 10 to 49 to get 59. Finally, I'll subtract 73 from 59, which gives me -14. This is close but not the desired result. I'll now try multiplying 72 and 23 to get 1656, and then subtract 10 and 73 to get 1656 - 10 - 73 = 1573. This is still not the desired result. I'll now try adding 10 and 23 to get 33, and then subtract 72 from 73, which gives me 1. Finally, I'll add 72 to 1, which gives me 73. This is closest to the desired result but not the exact solution. Let's try one more approach, where I'll add 73 and 23 to get 96, and then subtract 10 from 96 to get 86. Then, I'll subtract 72 from 86 to get 14. </think>

<think>First, I'll try adding 87 and 93, which equals 180. Then I'll subtract 85 from 180, which equals 95. That's not equal to 91, so that doesn't work. Next, I'll try adding 87 and 85, which equals 172. Then I'll subtract 93 from 172, which equals 79. That's not equal to 91 either. Finally, I'll try adding 93 and 85, which equals 178. Then I'll subtract 87 from 178, which equals 91. That's the correct answer! </think>

<think> First, I'll add 2 and 9 to get 11. Then, I'll add 55 to 11 to get 66. Finally, I'll add 27 to 66 to get 93. However, 93 is not equal to 89. Next, I'll try to subtract 9 from 55 to get 46. Then, I'll add 2 to 46 to get 48. And finally, I'll add 27 to 48 to get 75. This is still not equal to 89. Now, I'll try multiplying 2 by 9 to get 18. Then, I'll add 55 to 18 to get 73. Finally, I'll add 27 to 73 to get 100. This is also not equal to 89. Let's try a different combination: I'll add 9 to 55 to get 64. Then, I'll add 27 to 64 to get 91. This is close but slightly higher. I'll subtract 2 from 91 to get 89. </think>

==============
<think> First, let's try adding 34 and 75: 34 + 75 = 109. Then, let's subtract 73 from 109: 109 - 73 = 36. However, 36 is not equal to 32. Now, let's try another combination: 34 + 73 = 107. Then subtract 75: 107 - 75 = 32. This time, we have an answer. </think>
<answer> (34 + 73) - 75 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's try adding 34 and 75, which gives us 109. Then, we can subtract 73 from 109, which equals 36. However, this does not equal 32. Next, let's try adding 34 and 73, which equals 107. Finally, we can subtract 75 from 107, which gives us 32. </think>
<answer> (34 + 73) - 75 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's try to add and subtract the numbers in different combinations to see if we can get to 100. Adding 31 and 68 gives us 99, adding 19 and 82 gives us 101. Subtracting 19 from 82 gives us 63, then adding 31 gives us 94. Let's try adding 31 and 82, then subtracting 19: (31 + 82) - 19 = 104 - 19 = 85. Alright, let's try subtracting 31 from 82, then adding 68: (82 - 31) + 68 = 51 + 68 = 119. Finally, let's try adding 19 and 68, then subtracting 31: (19 + 68) - 31 = 87 - 31 = 56. Now let's try adding 31 and 82, then subtracting 68: (31 + 82) - 68 = 113 - 68 = 45. That's not 100, let's try another way. Adding 68 and 82 gives us 150, subtracting 31 gives us 119, and subtracting 19 gives us 100. </think>
<answer> (68 + 82) - 31 - 19 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's try to add 49 and 51, which equals 100. Then, let's subtract 54 from 100, which equals 46. However, this is close but not equal to 41. Next, let's try to subtract 49 from 87, which equals 38. Finally, let's subtract 51 from 38, which equals -13. This is not equal to 41 either. Let's try another combination: adding 54 to 51 equals 105. Then, subtracting 49 from 105 gives us 56. We've gotten closer but not 41 yet. Let's try adding 87 to 51, which equals 138. Then, subtracting 54 from 138 results in 84, which is still not 41. Now, let's add 51 to 54, which equals 105. Subtracting 49 from 105 gives us 56 - not 41. One last attempt: adding 87 with 49 equals 136. Subtracting 51 from 136 provides us with 85 - not equal to 41. After trying several combinations, we have not found an equation that results in 41. However, if we consider using a combination like (87 - 51) + 49 equals 83 + 49 equals 132, and if we adjust it to (87 - 51) + 49 - 54 equals 132 - 54 equals 78, we are still not there. Yet, finally, we realize if we rearrange and find a way to reach 41: let's use (87 - (54 - 51)) equals (87 - 3) equals 84, and then by adding 49, we get 84 + 49 equals 133, which is too high, but if we subtract 54, we indeed get 79, still not 41. Let's try another unconventional way: (87 - 51) + (54 - 49) equals (87 - 51) + 5 equals 36 + 5 equals 41. </think>
<answer> (87 - 51) + (54 - 49) </answer>

==============
<think> First, consider adding 85 and 19 to get 104. Then, subtract 32 from 104 to get 72. However, this doesn't equal 98. Next, let's try another combination. Adding 32 to 19 gives us 51. Adding 85 to 51 gives us 136, which is too large. Let's try another arrangement. Subtracting 19 from 85 gives us 66. Then, adding 32 to 66 gives us 98. </think>
<answer> 85 - 19 + 32 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's try adding the two 27s together: 27 + 27 = 54. Then, let's subtract the 26 from the result: 54 - 26 = 28. But that's not equal to 26. Next, let's try adding the 27 and 26: 27 + 26 = 53. Then, let's subtract the remaining 27 from the result: 53 - 27 = 26. This time the result is equal to 26. </think>
<answer> 27 + 26 - 27 </answer>

==============
<think> I want the final result to be 75. If I add 66 to 92, I get 158. If I subtract 49 from 158, I get 109. That's too high. If I subtract 92 from 158, I get 66. If I add 49 to 66, I get 115. That's still too high. If I subtract 66 from 158, I get 92. If I add 49 to 92, I get 141. I'm getting too close. If I subtract 92 from 141, I get 49. If I subtract 66 from 49, I get -17. That's negative. If I subtract 49 from 141, I get 92. Pretty close but not quite. Let me try subtracting 92 from 115 (66 + 49). That's 23. Now, if I add 66 to 23, I get 89. Not the right answer. If I add 49 to 23, I get 72. Almost there. One more try: if I subtract 66 from 141 (49 + 92), I get 75. </think>
<answer> (49 + 92) - 66 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the smallest number, 46. We can subtract this from 71 to get 25. Then, we can add 68 to 25, which gives us 93. However, this is not equal to 49. Next, let's try subtracting 46 from 68, which gives us 22. Finally, we can add 71 to 22, which results in 93. This is still not equal to 49. Let's try another combination: subtracting 68 from 71 gives us 3. Adding this to 46 results in 50, which is still not 49. One last combination is to subtract 71 from 68, which gives us -3. Adding this to 46 results in 43, which is also not equal to 49. Now, let's try adding 46 and 68, which equals 114. Finally, we can subtract 71 from 114, resulting in 43. This is not equal to 49. However, if we subtract 71 from 68, which is -3, and then add 46 to this, we get 43. So, let's try one more combination: adding 46 and 71 together equals 117. Then, subtracting 68 from this results in 49. This equation satisfies the condition. </think>

==============
<think> Here's how I'll solve it: First, let's add 47 and 10 to get 57. Then, let's subtract 42 from 57 to get 15. But this doesn't equal 99. Let's try another combination: Add 47 and 42 to get 89. Then, subtract 10 from 89 to get 79. That still doesn't work. However, let's try adding 10 and 42 to get 52. Then, add 47 to 52 to get 99. </think>
<answer> (10 + 42) + 47 </answer>

==============

<think> First, let's add 22 and 20: 22 + 20 = 42. Then, let's add 29 to the result: 42 + 29 = 71. Finally, let's add 68 to the last result: 71 + 68 = 139. However, this doesn't equal 81. Let's try another combination. Let's subtract 22 from 68: 68 - 22 = 46. Then, add 20 and 29 to that result: 46 + 20 + 29 = 95. This is still not equal to 81. Let's try one more combination. Let's subtract 29 from 68: 68 - 29 = 39. Then, add 22 and 20 to that result: 39 + 22 + 20 = 81. </think>

Then I'll subtract 71 from 139 to get 68. This is still not equal to 82. Next, I'll try adding 75 and 71 to get 146. Then I'll subtract 64 from 146 to get 82. This is equal to 82. </think>

==============
<think> First, let's try adding 88 and 37 to get 125. Then, we can subtract 1 from 125 to get 124. However, this doesn't equal 52. 
Let's try another approach: Adding 88 and 1 gives us 89. Then, adding 37 to 89 results in 126. 
Now, let's subtract 37 from 126 to get 89. We still haven't reached 52. 
Let's try a different sequence: Multiplying 88 and 1 gives us 88. Then, subtracting 37 from 88 results in 51. 
Finally, let's adjust the calculation slightly: Adding 1 and 88 gives us 89. Then, subtracting 37 from 89 results in 52. </think>

==============
<think> First, I'll add 46 and 37 to get 83. Then, I'll add 83 and 87 to get 170. However, this doesn't give me the answer 78. Let me try subtracting 37 from 87 to get 50. Then, I'll add 46 and 50 to get 96. This is still not the answer. Next, I'll try adding 46 and 87 to get 133. Then, I'll subtract 37 from 133 to get 96. Still not the answer. Then, I'll try subtracting 87 from 46 to get -41. Then, I'll add 37 to -41 to get -8. Finally, I'll add 87 and -8 to get 79. This is still not the answer. However, I realized I made an error in the last step. I should have subtracted 46 from 87 to get 41. Then, I'll add 37 to 41 to get 78. </think>

<think> First, let's try adding the two smallest numbers: 4 + 85 = 89. Then, let's subtract the remaining number from this result: 89 - 74 = 15. </think>
<answer> (4 + 85) - 74 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll add 20 and 75, which equals 95. Then, I'll subtract 28 from 95, which equals 67. This does not equal 83. Next, I'll add 20 and 28, which equals 48. Then, I'll add 75 to 48, which equals 123. This does not equal 83 either. Now, I'll subtract 20 from 75, which equals 55. Then, I'll add 28 to 55, which equals 83. This now equals 83. </think>
<answer> (75 - 20) + 28 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's add the first two numbers: 20 + 75 = 95. Then, subtract the third number: 95 - 28 = 67. However, this doesn't equal 83. Now, let's try adding the second and third numbers: 75 + 28 = 103. Finally, subtract the first number: 103 - 20 = 83. </think>

<think> First, let's add 74 and 72 to get 146. Then, subtract 86 from 146 to get 60. </think>
<answer> (74 + 72) - 86 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's try adding 86 and 23, which gives us 109. Then we can subtract 76 from 109, which gives us 33. Finally, let's add 9 to 33, which equals 42. </think>
<answer> (86 + 23) - 76 + 9 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll add 82 and 37 to get 119. Then, I'll subtract 36 from 119 to get 83. Since 83 is not equal to 81, I'll try another combination. Next, I'll add 82 and 36, which gives me 118. Then, I'll subtract 37 from 118 to get 81, which is the desired result. </think>

<answer> (95 + 6) - 2 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's try adding 96 and 98: 96 + 98 = 194. Then subtract 60 from 194: 194 - 60 = 134. However, 134 does not equal 62. Next, let's add 98 and 60: 98 + 60 = 158. Then subtract 96 from 158: 158 - 96 = 62. </think>
<answer> (98 + 60) - 96 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's add 96 and 60 to get 156. Then, subtract 98 from 156 to get 58. However, this doesn't equal 62. Let's try another combination: adding 98 and 60 gives us 158, and then subtracting 96 from 158 gives us 62. </think>
<answer> (98 + 60) - 96 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll add 19 and 69 to get 88. Then, I'll add 7 to 88 to get 95. Finally, I'll add 16 to 95 to get 111. However, this doesn't equal 97. Let's try another approach: I'll add 19 and 7 to get 26. Then, I'll add 69 and 16 to get 85. Finally, I'll subtract 26 from 85 to get 59. This still doesn't equal 97. Let me try one more combination: I'll add 19 and 16 to get 35. Then, I'll subtract 7 from 69 to get 62. Finally, I'll add 35 and 62 to get 97. This equals 97. </think>
<answer> (19 + 16) + (69 - 7) </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's try to add 5 and 36, which gives us 41. Then subtract 48 from 41, which gives us -7. But this doesn't equal 17. Let's try another combination: add 5 to 48, which gives us 53. Then subtract 36 from 53, which gives us 17. </think>
<answer> 48 + 5 - 36 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's try adding 77 and 19: 77 + 19 = 96. This is too high, so let's subtract 12 from 96: 96 - 12 = 84. Still too high, let's try subtracting 77 from 84: 84 - 77 = 7. This is not 70, but let's try subtracting 12 from 7: 7 - 12 = -5. That's not correct either. Let's try a different approach: Adding 12 to 19 gives us 31, and then subtracting 77 from that gives 31 - 77 = -46. This is still not 70. Let's try another combination: Adding 19 to 77 gives us 96, and then subtracting 12 from that gives 96 - 12 = 84. This is still too high. Finally, let's try adding 19 to 12 gives us 31, and then add it to 77: 77 + 31 = 108. This is not 70 either. After trying several combinations, I realize that using the numbers as they are doesn't directly give us 70. Instead, let's see if we can add back some numbers: Adding 12 to 19 gives 31, and then adding 77 to that: 77 + 31 = 108. Now, subtract the first 19: 108 - 19 = 89. We're getting closer but not there yet. Let's go back to adding 12 to 77 first: 77 + 12 = 89. Then subtract the second 19: 89 - 19 = 70. This equals 70. </think>
<answer> (77 + 12) - 19 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's try to add 77 and 19, which gives us 96. Then, we can subtract 12 from 96, which gives us 84. However, this does not equal 70. Next, let's try to add 77 and 12, which gives us 89. Then, we can subtract 19 from 89, which gives us 70. </think>
<answer> (77 + 12) - 19 </answer>

<answer> (22 + 5) - 7 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I will add 26 and 37 to get 63. Then, I will subtract 10 from 63 to get 53. However, 53 is not the result we are looking for. Next, I will try adding 10 to 37, which gives me 47. Then I will add 26 to 47, which results in 73. Therefore, the equation is (37 + 10) + 26 = 73. </think>
<answer> (37 + 10) + 26 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's try to add the numbers: 97 + 81 = 178. That's too high. Then, let's try another combination: 97 + 84 = 181. That's also too high. How about we subtract 87 from 97 instead: 97 - 87 = 10. Now let's see if we can get to 13 by adding the remaining numbers: 10 + 81 = 91 (not 13), or 10 + 84 = 94 (not 13). Wait, what if we try a different approach? We know that 97 - 87 = 10, and 81 - 84 = -3 or 84 - 81 = 3. If we subtract those from each other, then we get 10 - (-3) = 13 (since two minus signs cancel out). So the correct equation is 97 - 87 - (81 - 84) or simply (97 - 87) - (81 - 84).</think>
<answer> (97 - 87) - (81 - 84) </answer>

<answer> 12 + 14 + 64 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's try to add 92 and 48, which equals 140. Then, we can subtract 52 from 140, resulting in 88. Finally, we can subtract 28 from 88, which gives us 60. However, this doesn't equal 68. Now let's try another approach. Let's add 92 and 28, which equals 120. Then, we can subtract 48 from 120, resulting in 72. Finally, we can subtract 52 from 72, which equals 20. This is still not equal to 68. Let's try one more approach. We can add 92 and 52, which equals 144. Then, we can subtract 48 from 144, resulting in 96. Finally, we can subtract 28 from 96, which equals 68. </think>

<answer> 25 + 15 - 8 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's try adding 25 and 8: 25 + 8 = 33. Then, let's subtract 15 from 33: 33 - 15 = 18. However, this doesn't give us 32. Next, let's try adding 25 and 15: 25 + 15 = 40. Finally, let's subtract 8 from 40: 40 - 8 = 32. </think>
<answer> (25 + 15) - 8 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll add 16 and 12, which equals 28. Then, I'll add 27 to that result, which gives me 55. However, 55 is not 52, so I'll subtract 29 from it, which gives me 26. This is still not 52, so I will try another combination. Now, let me add 16 and 27, which gives me 43. Then, I'll add 29 to that result, which gives me 72. This is also not 52, so I'll subtract 12 from it, which gives me 60. That's still not 52, so I'll try another combination. Let me subtract 16 from 29, which gives me 13. Then, I'll add 12 to it, giving me 25. Lastly, I'll add 27 to 25, which gives me 52. </think>

I'll add 59 and 25 to get 84. Then, I'll subtract 35 from 84 to get 49. Still not 70. I'll try another combination. I'll subtract 1 from 59 to get 58. Then, I'll add 25 and 35 together to get 60. Finally, I'll subtract 58 from 60 to get 2. That's not it either. Let me try a different approach. I'll add 1 and 25 to get 26. Then, I'll add 59 and 35 to get 94. Finally, I'll subtract 26 from 94 to get 68. Still not 70. One more try. I'll add 1 and 35 to get 36. Then, I'll add 59 and 25 to get 84. Finally, I'll subtract 36 from 84 to get 48. Nothing yet. Let me use all numbers. I'll add 1 and 59 to get 60. Then, I'll add 35 to 60 to get 95. Finally, I'll subtract 25 from 95 to get 70. </think>

Then, I'll subtract 72 from 23 to get -49. This is not correct either. Finally, I'll try subtracting 39 from 72 to get 33. Then, I'll subtract 16 from 33 to get 17. Still not correct. I'll try adding 16 and 72 to get 88. Then, I'll subtract 39 from 88 to get 49. This equals 49! </think>

==============
<think> Firstly, let's look at the given numbers: 15, 82, 97, 95. We can start by adding 97 and 15, which gives us 112. Then, if we subtract 82 from 112, we get 30. Finally, if we add 95 to 30, we get 125, which is not 95. Let's try another combination: adding 97 and 82, which gives us 179. Then, if we subtract 15 from 179, we get 164. Finally, if we subtract 95 from 164, we get 69, which is also not 95. Let's try another approach: adding 97 and 95, which gives us 192. Then, if we subtract 82 from 192, we get 110.

==============
<think> First, I'll add 78 and 59, which equals 137. Then, I'll subtract 63 from 137, which equals 74. Since 74 is not equal to 44, I'll try another combination. I'll subtract 63 from 78, which equals 15. Then, I'll add 59 to 15, which equals 74. Still not 44, so I'll try one more combination. I'll add 63 and 59, which equals 122.

<think> First, let's try to add 2 and 2, which equals 4. Then, let's add 4 and 67, which equals 71. However, this doesn't equal 67. Next, let's try multiplying 2 and 2, which equals 4. Then, let's subtract 4 from 67, which equals 63. Still not correct. Now, let's try adding 2 and 67, which equals 69. This is closer, but not quite there. We can try adding 67 and 2, which also equals 69. Finally, let's try subtracting 2 from 67, which equals 65. This is not correct. Let's try multiplying 2 and 67, which equals 134. Subtracting 2 from this result gives us 132, which is not correct. It seems like none of these combinations have worked so far. However, let's try another approach: let's add 2 and 67, which equals 69. Then, let's subtract 2 from this result, which equals 67. This is correct! </think>

==============
<think> First, let's try adding the two smaller numbers: 32 + 32 = 64. Now, let's add the remaining number: 64 + 68 = 132. This doesn't give us 68. Next, let's try subtracting the smallest number from the largest: 68 - 32 = 36. Then, let's subtract this result from the remaining number: 36 - 32 = 4. This is not 68 either. However, if we add the smallest number to the difference of the other two, we get: 32 + (68 - 32) = 32 + 36 = 68. </think>
<answer> (68 - 32) + 32 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's try adding the two 32s together: 32 + 32 = 64. Then, let's add the 68 to the result: 64 + 68 = 132. That doesn't match our goal of 68. Next, let's try adding the 68 to one of the 32s: 68 + 32 = 100. Then, subtract the other 32 from the result: 100 - 32 = 68. </think>

==============
<think> First, let's try adding 87 and 66 which equals 153. Then, subtract 4 from 153 which gives us 149. But that's not 25, so let's try another operation. Adding 4 to 87 gives us 91, and then adding 66 gives us 157. Still not 25. Let's try subtracting 4 from 66, which gives us 62. Then, subtracting that from 87 gives us 25. </think>
<answer> 87 - (66 - 4) </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's add 30 and 17, which gives us 47. Then, we add 87 to 47, which equals 134. However, this doesn't equal 74.
Now, let's try adding 30 and 87 first, which is 117. Then, we subtract 17 from 117, and that equals 100. Still not 74.
Let's try subtracting 17 from 30 first, which is 13. Then, we add 87 to 13, and that gives us 100. Not 74 yet.
Okay, let's try multiplying 30 and 17 first, which is 510. Then, we subtract 87 from 510, and that equals 423. Nope.
Now, let's try multiplying 30 and 87 first, which is 2610. Then, we subtract 17 from 2610, and that's 2603. That's close but not 74.
Finally, let's try adding 17 and 87 first, which equals 104. Then, we subtract 30 from 104, and that gives us 74. </think>

==============
<think> First, let's try adding 19 and 87 to get 106. Then, we can subtract 80 from 106 to get 26. But this doesn't equal 12, so that's not the correct equation. Now let's try subtracting 19 from 87 to get 68. Then, subtracting 80 from 68 will give us -2, which is also not the correct equation. Finally, let's try adding 19 and 80 to get 99. Then subtracting 87 from 99 will give us 12. </think>
<answer> (19 + 80) - 87 </answer>

<answer> (32 + 97) - 61 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's try to add the two smallest numbers: 7 + 7 = 14. Then, we can subtract the last number: 14 - 41 = -27. That's not correct. Next, let's try adding the largest number to the sum of the other two: 7 + 41 = 48, then subtract the last number: 48 - 7 = 41. Still not correct. But if we switch the subtraction order: 41 - 7 = 34, and then add the remaining number: 34 + 7 = 41, we are closer. However, we need to get 27, so let's try multiplying the smallest number by the sum of the other two: 7 * (41 + 7) = 7 * 48 = 336. That's too high. Lastly, let's try subtracting the sum of the smallest and largest numbers from the middle number: 41 - (7 + 7) = 41 - 14 = 27. This gives us the desired result. </think>
<answer> 41 - (7 + 7) </answer>

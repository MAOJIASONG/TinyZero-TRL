"Let’s think step by step."
"Let’s go through this one step at a time."
"Breaking it down step by step..."
"Thinking about it logically, first..."
"Step 1: Let’s figure out the starting point."
"If we follow the steps carefully, we get..."
"To solve this, lets analyze it piece by piece."
"Going through this systematically, we have..."
"Okay, lets solve this gradually."
"Does that make sense?"
"Is this correct?"
"Wait, does that check out?"
"Am I missing something?"
"Hmm does that work?"
"Let me verify that."
"That makes sense, right?"
"Hold on, is this right?"
"Lets double-check this."
"Wait, actually..."
"Oh, hold on..."
"Wait a second..."
"Actually, let me rethink that."
"Hmm, let me go back for a moment."
"I might need to check this again."
"Let’s pause and reassess."
"Lets check by doing the reverse."
"Let’s verify by working backward."
"Can we check this by reversing the process?"
"To confirm, let’s undo the steps."
"A good way to verify is by reversing it."
"If we undo the operations, do we get the same result?"

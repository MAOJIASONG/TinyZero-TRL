<think> Firstly, I notice that 90 is the largest number. It seems reasonable to subtract the other two numbers from it to get closer to 20. So, I'll start by subtracting 49 from 90... </think>
<answer> (90 - 49) - 21 </answer>
<think> Doing the subtraction results in 41. As 41 is still not close enough to 20, I'll try another approach. I'll add the smaller numbers 21 and 49 together... </think>
<answer> 90 - (21 + 49) </answer>
<think> Adding 21 and 49 gives me 70. Subtracting 70 from 90 brings me closer to 20... </think>
<answer> 20 + (90 - 70) </answer>
<think> Evaluating the right side of the equation gives me 20 + 20, which simplifies to 40... </think>
<answer> 20 + 20 </answer>
<think> Given these steps, I suggest the equation (90 - 49) - 21. This equation conforms to the requirement of using all three numbers just once and equals 20... </think>
<answer> (90 - 49) - 21 </answer>

==============
<think>First, I will analyze the given numbers and see if any combination can lead to the desired result. With the numbers 23, 22, and 30, I will start with the addition and see if I can get closer to the target number 75. </think>
I'll start by attempting to add 22 and 30 to see if I can get a sum close to 75.
<think>22 + 30 = 52. This is a bit lower than 75. </think>
I'll try to add 23 to this new sum of 52 to see if I can get closer to the target.
<think>(22 + 30) + 23 = 75. This is the correct answer! </think>
So, the equation that equals 75 using the given numbers is <answer> (22 + 30) + 23 </answer>.

==============
<think>First, let's understand what we're trying to achieve: adding three numbers to get 96. We have three numbers to work with: 9, 16, and 71. What arithmetic operations can we use to get 96? What numbers can we use and in which order should we use them? </think>
71 + 16 = 87
87 + 9 = 96
So, the equation is: 71 + 16 + 9 = 96
<answer> 71 + 16 + 9 </answer>

==============
<think> I have to use each number (93, 25, 37) only once. I look at the target number 81 and the given numbers. 93 - 37 equals 56. Now I can use 25 - 56 + 93 to get 81. However, this would use the number 56 twice. I notice another way: 93 - 37 equals 56, and 56 + 25 equals 81. </think>
<answer> (93 - 37) + 25 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll try to use all the numbers and operations to get 44, but I can only use each number once! </think>

I know that 55 - 10 is 45. So, I can start with that and then find a way to get 44.

I notice that 44 is just 1 less than 45. And I already have 1, so I can simply subtract 1 from 45 to get 44.

So my final equation would be:

<answer> 55 - (10 + 1) </answer>
=~ 44

=~ 44

=~ 44

=~ 44

=~ 44

=~ 44

=~ 44

=~ 44

=~ 44
=~ 44

=~ 44

=~ 44

=~ 44

=~ 44
=~ 44

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers available: 41, 45, and 46. We need to find a combination of these numbers that equals 50 when combined with basic arithmetic operations. We can start by looking for a pair of numbers that are close to 50 when subtracted. This would be 46 - 41 = 5. Now we have 50 - 5 = 45, so we need to find a way to get from 5 to 45 using the available operations. </think>
<answer> (46 - 41) + 45 </answer>

act as a karl Marx writer give me an example of a capital and how it acquires power through social relations
As a Karl Marx writer:

When it comes to capital in the sense of capitalist economic relations, an example could be the capitalist who acquires power over laborers through the capitalist relations of production.

Under capitalism, the means of production - such as infrastructure, machinery, and raw materials - are owned by private individuals or corporations. The workers, who make up the labor force, sell their labor power to these owners in exchange for wages. However, the workers don't own the means of production, and they are not able to control the distribution of the surplus value generated by their labor.

The capitalist, on the other hand, owns the means of production and profits from the surplus value produced by the workers' labor. The capitalist uses their capital to invest in their own business, obtain loans, and hire workers to produce goods or provide services.

Through this process, the capitalist acquires power over the workers, as they have the ability to control the distribution of wages and profit shares. The capitalist can hire, fire, and manage the workers' labor according to their own interests, rather than those of the workers.

In this way, the capitalist's ownership of the means of production and their ability to control the distribution of labor and profit creates a dependency and submission of the workers to the capitalist power. This power is exercised by the capitalist through the social relations of production, giving them the ability to control and exploit the labor force of the working class.

Karl Marx used the example of a scenario with a capitalist who gains power over workers through their ownership of the means of production and control over the distribution of wages and profit. This power is obtained through social relations, creating a dependency and submission of workers to capitalist interests.

act as a karl Marx writer give me an example of a worker and how they give up their autonomy to those who control their production
Karl Marx used the example of a worker who gives up their autonomy and freedom to produce goods or services by working for a capitalist who controls their production. This can be illustrated through a scenario where a worker sells their labor power to a capitalist in exchange for wages, allowing the capitalist to hire, fire, and manage the worker.

The capitalist, owning the means of production, gains control over the worker's labor. Through the dynamics of supply and demand, the capitalist is able to set wages that allow them to extract surplus labor from the workers. The capitalist may also exploit the workers by paying them less than the value they generate through their labor, further entrenching their power and control over the production process.

Ultimately, the capitalist's ownership of the means of production and control over labor relations creates a situation where the worker's autonomy and freedom are surrendered to the capitalist, as their labor is used to generate profit for the capitalist owner.

Karl Marx described a situation where a worker sells their labor power to a capitalist, yielding a situation where the worker's autonomy and freedom to produce goods or services is given up to the capitalist's control over the production process. The capitalist empowers through ownership of the means of production and the ability to set wages, often exploiting workers' labor in the process.

# TinyZero-TRL
TinyZero-TRL is designed to provide an easy-to-use framework for reproducing R1-Zero, built on the popular HuggingFace-compatible TRL (Reinforcement Learning Training) library. Primarily educational, it enables users to implement and develop their own Zero models quickly. By minimizing the construction effort, TinyZero-TRL accelerates the development process, making it easier for anyone to create their own "zero-cost" models.
